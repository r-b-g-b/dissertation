abstract = {Synaptic plasticity provides the basis for most models of learning, memory and development in neural circuits. To generate realistic results, synapse-specific Hebbian forms of plasticity, such as long-term potentiation and depression, must be augmented by global processes that regulate overall levels of neuronal and network activity. Regulatory processes are often as important as the more intensively studied Hebbian processes in determining the consequences of synaptic plasticity for network function. Recent experimental results suggest several novel mechanisms for regulating levels of activity in conjunction with Hebbian synaptic modification. We review three of them-synaptic scaling, spike-timing dependent plasticity and synaptic redistribution-and discuss their functional implications.},

abstract = {The inferior colliculus is a central auditory structure which serves as a site for the integration of ascending and descending auditory information. Changes in central auditory structures may occur with acoustic exposure, which cannot be explained by alterations in cochlear function alone. Rats were exposed to a 10-kHz tone at 100dB SPL for 9h. Auditory brainstem response measures showed an initial 25-30-dB threshold shift across all tested frequencies. By 30days post-exposure, thresholds for clicks and most frequencies returned to near control levels; however, thresholds remained elevated at 10 and 20kHz. Inner hair cell loss was confined to apical and basal ends of the cochlea, and did not exceed 20\%. Inferior colliculus levels of the two isoforms of the GABA synthetic enzyme glutamate decarboxylase (65,000 and 67,000 mol. wt forms) were measured immediately post-exposure (0h) and at two and 30days post-exposure using quantitative immunocytochemical and western blotting techniques. Zero-hour measures revealed a significant increase in the level of glutamate decarboxylase (mol. wt 67,000) protein (118\%), as well as in the optical density (35\%) of immunolabeled cells. By 30days post-exposure, inferior colliculus protein levels of both glutamate decarboxylase isoforms were significantly below unexposed controls (39\% and 21\% for the 65,000 and 67,000 mol. wt forms, respectively).These studies describe increased markers for GABA immediately following acoustic exposure, followed by a decline to below control levels from two to 30days post-exposure. It remains to be determined whether noise trauma-induced changes in glutamate decarboxylase levels in the inferior colliculus reflect protective up-regulation in response to intense stimulation, followed by the establishment of new neurotransmitter equilibrium levels.

The purpose of this study was to examine global protein expression levels of GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors, and GABAergic enzymes and trafficking proteins in fragile X knockout mice during brain maturation. Quantitative western blotting of homogenates of forebrain revealed that the levels of GABA(A) beta1 and beta3, GABA(B)-R1, NKCC1, KCC2, gephyrin and ubiquilin were not significantly different from wild-type mice at any of the postnatal time points examined. In contrast, the GABA(A) receptor alpha1, beta2, and delta subunits, and the GABA enzymes GABA transaminase and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase were down-regulated during postnatal development, while GAD65 was up-regulated in the adult knockout mouse brain. The GABA(A) receptor alpha1 and beta2 subunits displayed a divergent pattern of developmental expression whereby alpha1 was reduced in the immature brain but regained a level of expression similar to wild-type mice by adulthood, while the expression of beta2 was similar to wild-types at postnatal day 5 but reduced at day 12 and in the adult brain. The GABA(A) receptor delta subunit and the GABA catabolic enzymes GABA transaminase and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase were simultaneously but transiently decreased only at postnatal day 12. Our results demonstrate that GABA(A) receptor subunits and GABA enzymes display complex patterns of changes during brain development suggesting that dynamic interactions may occur between GABA transmitter levels and GABA receptors in fragile X syndrome.},

abstract = {The cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF), well-known for its roles in cellular responses to tissue injury, has recently been shown to be produced in response to physiological activity in neuronal circuits. TNF stimulates receptors in neurons linked to the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB, and recent findings suggest that this signaling pathway can modulate neuronal excitability and vulnerability of neurons to excitotoxicity. Because data indicate that TNF is produced, and NF-kappaB activated, under conditions associated with learning and memory, we performed experiments in the hippocampal slice preparation aimed at elucidating roles for TNF and NF-kappaB in modulating synaptic plasticity. Whereas stimulation of Schaffer collateral axons at a frequency of 1 Hz induced long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission in region CA1 of wild-type mice, LTD did not occur in slices from TNF receptor knockout mice. Stimulation at 100 Hz induced long-term potentiation (LTP) in slices from both wild-type mice and mice lacking TNF receptors. Basal transmission was unaltered in mice lacking TNF receptors. Pretreatment of slices from wild-type mice with kappaB decoy DNA prevented induction of LTD and significantly reduced the magnitude of LTP. Collectively, these data suggest important roles for TNF and signaling pathways that modulate NF-kappaB activity in regulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity.},

abstract = {Chronic inactivation of a neural network is known to induce homeostatic upregulation of synaptic strength, a form of synaptic plasticity that differs from Hebbian-type synaptic plasticity in that it is not input-specific, but involves all synapses of an individual neuron. However, it is unclear how homeostatic and Hebbian synaptic plasticity interact in the same neuron. Here we show that long-term potentiation (LTP) at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses is greatly enhanced in cultured mouse hippocampal slices after chronic (60 h) network-activity blockade with tetrodotoxin (TTX). This increase in LTP is not due to an altered synaptic NMDA receptor composition or presynaptic function. Instead, we found that silencing neural network activity not only increases the abundance of both AMPA and NMDA receptors at existing synapses as previously described, but also promotes the presence of new glutamatergic synapses that contain only NMDA receptors-a class of synapses that are functionally silent due to the absence of AMPA receptors. Induction of LTP in TTX-treated neurons leads to insertion of AMPA receptors into the silent synapses, thereby "switching on" these silent synapses, which produces the observed enhancement of LTP magnitude. Our findings suggest that homeostatic synaptic plasticity manifests not only in the adjustment of the strength of existing synapses, but also in the modulation of new synapse formation/maintenance. Moreover, presence of new but functionally silent synapses enables more robust LTP to occur through rapid conversion of silent synapses to active synapses, resulting in a stronger input-specific modulation of synapses following prolonged network silencing.},

Fourteen subjects (approximately 25\% of the sample) scored above the cutoff for autism, suggesting a relatively high incidence of autistic behavior. All but 2 of these 14 were in the mildly or moderately autistic range, however, and only a few items received severe ratings, suggesting that severe autism is relatively rare in fraX, at least during the early years. The CARS resulted in a continuum of autistic ratings in the fraX population, but no particular items on the CARS contributed disproportionately to autism ratings. A visual comparison of ratings on an autistic, non-fraX sample revealed similar profiles of ratings, suggesting that differentiating fraX and autism on the basis of CARS ratings is not likely. Within the fraX group, chronological age and socioeconomic status did not correlate with CARS ratings, but severity of delay was strongly related, such that more severely delayed children scored higher (more autistic) on the CARS.},

Exposure to acoustic features produces age-dependent changes through largely unresolved cellular mechanisms and sites of origin. We isolated the refinement of auditory thalamocortical connectivity by in vivo recordings and day-by-day voltage-sensitive dye imaging in an acute brain slice preparation. Passive tone-rearing modified response strength and topography in mouse primary auditory cortex (A1) during a brief, 3-d window, but did not alter tonotopic maps in the thalamus. Gene-targeted deletion of a forebrain-specific cell-adhesion molecule (Icam5) accelerated plasticity in this critical period. Consistent with its normal role of slowing spinogenesis, loss of Icam5 induced precocious stubby spine maturation on pyramidal cell dendrites in neocortical layer 4 (L4), identifying a primary locus of change for the tonotopic plasticity. The evolving postnatal connectivity between thalamus and cortex in the days following hearing onset may therefore determine a critical period for auditory processing.},

One of these consequences is long-term depression (LTD) of transmission at hippocampal synapses. Loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), the defect responsible for fragile X syndrome in humans, increases LTD in mouse hippocampus. This finding is consistent with the growing evidence that FMRP normally functions as a repressor of translation of specific mRNAs. Here we present a theory that can account for diverse neurological and psychiatric aspects of fragile X syndrome, based on the assumption that many of the protein-synthesis-dependent functions of metabotropic receptors are exaggerated in fragile X syndrome. The theory suggests new directions for basic research as well as novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of humans with fragile X, the most frequent inherited cause of mental retardation and an identified cause of autism.},

@article{Berlucchi2009,
abstract = {In this paper, we outline some important milestones in the history of the term "plasticity" in reference to the nervous system. Credit is given to William James for first adopting the term to denote changes in nervous paths associated with the establishment of habits; to Eugenio Tanzi for first identifying the articulations between neurons, not yet called synapses, as possible sites of neural plasticity; to Ernesto Lugaro for first linking neural plasticity with synaptic plasticity; and to Cajal for complementing Tanzi's hypothesis with his own hypothesis of plasticity as the result of the formation of new connections between cortical neurons. Cajal's early use of the word plasticity is demonstrated, and his subsequent avoidance of the term is tentatively accounted for by the fact that other authors extended it to mean neuronal reactions partly pathological and no doubt quite different from those putatively associated with normal learning. Evidence is furnished that in the first two decades of the twentieth century the theory was generally accepted that learning is based on a reduced resistance at exercized synapses, and that neural processes become associated by coactivation. Subsequently the theory fell in disgrace when Lashley's ideas about mass action and functional equipotentiality of the cortex tended to outmode models of the brain based on orthodox neural circuitry. The synaptic plasticity theory of learning was rehabilitated in the late 1940s when Konorski and particularly Hebb argued successfully that there was no better alternative way to think about the modifiability of the brain by experience and practice. Hebb's influential hypothesis about the mechanism of adult learning contained elements strikingly similar to the early speculations of James, Tanzi and Cajal, but Hebb did not acknowledge specifically these roots of his thinking about the brain, though he was fully aware that he had resurrected old ideas wrongly neglected for a long time. Lately the concept of neural plasticity has been complicated by attributing considerably different meanings to it. A scholarly paper by Paillard is used to show how an analysis in depth can clarify some confusion engendered by an unrestricted use of the concept and term of neural plasticity.},

abstract = {Autism is a pervasive developmental disorder appearing before the age of 3, where communication and social interactions are impaired. It also entails stereotypic behavior or restricted interests. Although this disorder was first described in 1943, little is still known about its etiology and that of related developmental disorders. Work with human patients has provided many data on neuropathological and cognitive symptoms, but our understanding of the functional defects at the cellular level and how they come about remains sketchy. To improve this situation, autism research is in need of valid animal models. However, despite a strong hereditary component, attempts to identify genes have generally failed, suggesting that many different genes are involved. As a high proportion of patients suffering from the Fragile X Syndrome show many autistic symptoms, a mouse model of this disorder could potentially also serve as a model for autism. The Fmr1 KO mouse is a valid model of the Fragile X Syndrome and many data on behavioral and sensory-motor characteristics of this model have been gathered. We present here an assessment of autistic features in this candidate model. We conclude that Fmr1 KO mice display several autistic-like features, but more work is needed to validate this model.},

abstract = {1. The after-effects of repetitive stimulation of the perforant path fibres to the dentate area of the hippocampal formation have been examined with extracellular micro-electrodes in rabbits anaesthetized with urethane.2. In fifteen out of eighteen rabbits the population response recorded from granule cells in the dentate area to single perforant path volleys was potentiated for periods ranging from 30 min to 10 hr after one or more conditioning trains at 10-20/sec for 10-15 sec, or 100/sec for 3-4 sec.3. The population response was analysed in terms of three parameters: the amplitude of the population excitatory post-synaptic potential (e.p.s.p.), signalling the depolarization of the granule cells, and the amplitude and latency of the population spike, signalling the discharge of the granule cells.4. All three parameters were potentiated in 29\% of the experiments; in other experiments in which long term changes occurred, potentiation was confined to one or two of the three parameters. A reduction in the latency of the population spike was the commonest sign of potentiation, occurring in 57\% of all experiments. The amplitude of the population e.p.s.p. was increased in 43\%, and of the population spike in 40\%, of all experiments.5. During conditioning at 10-20/sec there was massive potentiation of the population spike (;frequency potentiation'). The spike was suppressed during stimulation at 100/sec. Both frequencies produced long-term potentiation.6. The results suggest that two independent mechanisms are responsible for long-lasting potentiation: (a) an increase in the efficiency of synaptic transmission at the perforant path synapses; (b) an increase in the excitability of the granule cell population.},

abstract = {Excessive exposure to loud noise can damage the cochlea and create a hearing loss. These pathologies coincide with a range of CNS changes including reorganisation of frequency representation, alterations in the pattern of spontaneous activity and changed expression of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. Moreover, damage to the cochlea is often accompanied by acoustic disorders such as hyperacusis and tinnitus, suggesting that one or more of these neuronal changes may be involved in these disorders, although the mechanisms remain unknown. We tested the hypothesis that excessive noise exposure increases expression of markers of excitation and plasticity, and decreases expression of inhibitory markers over a 32-day recovery period. Adult rats (n = 25) were monaurally exposed to a loud noise (16 kHz, 1/10(th) octave band pass (115 dB SPL)) for 1-hour, or left as non-exposed controls (n = 5). Animals were euthanased at either 0, 4, 8, 16 or 32 days following acoustic trauma. We used Western Blots to quantify protein levels of GABA(A) receptor subunit $\alpha$1 (GABA(A)$\alpha$1), Glutamic-Acid Decarboxylase-67 (GAD-67), N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor subunit 2A (NR2A), Calbindin (Calb1) and Growth Associated Protein 43 (GAP-43) in the Auditory Cortex (AC), Inferior Colliculus (IC) and Dorsal Cochlear Nucleus (DCN). Compared to sham-exposed controls, noise-exposed animals had significantly (p<0.05): lower levels of GABA(A)$\alpha$1 in the contralateral AC at day-16 and day-32, lower levels of GAD-67 in the ipsilateral DCN at day-4, lower levels of Calb1 in the ipsilateral DCN at day-0, lower levels of GABA(A)$\alpha$1 in the ipsilateral AC at day-4 and day-32. GAP-43 was reduced in the ipsilateral AC for the duration of the experiment.

Although the specific changes that occur appear to vary depending on the experimental preparation, their net effect is to counter the experimentally induced modification of activity. Such adaptive, cell-wide changes in synaptic strength serve to stabilize neuronal activity and are collectively referred to as homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Recent studies have shed light on what triggers homeostatic synaptic plasticity, whether or not it is distinct from other forms of synaptic plasticity and whether or not it occurs in the intact brain.},

Extracellular injections of biocytin into the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) revealed that although the cochlear nuclei are smaller in je/je mice, the topography in its innervation resembles that in wild-type mice. Auditory nerve fibers innervate narrow, topographically organized, "isofrequency" bands in deaf animals over the ages examined, P18-P70. The projection of tuberculoventral cells was topographic in je/je as in wild-type mice. Terminals of auditory nerve fibers in the multipolar cell area included both large and small endings, whereas in the octopus cell area they were exclusively small boutons in je/je as in wild-type mice, but end bulbs near the nerve root of je/je animals were smaller than in hearing animals. In whole-cell recordings from targets of auditory nerve fibers, octopus and T stellate cells, miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) had similar shapes as in +/+, indicating that the properties of AMPA receptors were not affected by the mutation. In je/je animals the frequency of spontaneous mEPSCs was elevated, and synaptic depression in responses to trains of shocks delivered at between 100 and 333 Hz was greater than in wild-type mice, indicating that the probability of neurotransmitter release was increased. The frequency of spontaneous mEPSCs and extent of synaptic depression were greater in octopus than in T stellate cells, in both wild-type and in je/je mice.},

abstract = {The mechanisms by which hearing selectivity is elaborated and refined in early development are very incompletely determined. In this study, we documented contributions of progressively maturing inhibitory influences on the refinement of spectral and temporal response properties in the primary auditory cortex. Inhibitory receptive fields (IRFs) of infant rat auditory cortical neurons were spectrally far broader and had extended over far longer duration than did those of adults. The selective refinement of IRFs was delayed relative to that of excitatory receptive fields by an approximately 2-week period that corresponded to the critical period for plasticity. Local application of a GABA(A) receptor antagonist revealed that intracortical inhibition contributes to this progressive receptive field maturation for response selectivity in frequency. Conversely, it had no effect on the duration of IRFs or successive-signal cortical response recovery times. The importance of exposure to patterned acoustic inputs was suggested when both spectral and temporal IRF maturation were disrupted in rat pups reared in continuous, moderate-intensity noise. They were subsequently renormalized when animals were returned to standard housing conditions as adults.},

Although the cognitive defect is the most recognized symptom of fragile X syndrome, patients also show behavioral problems such as hyperarousal, hyperactivity, autism, aggression, anxiety and increased sensitivity to sensory stimuli. Here we investigated whether fragile X mice (fmr-1 gene knockout mice) exhibit abnormal sensitivity to sensory stimuli. First, hyperreactivity of fragile X mice to auditory stimulus was indicated in the prepulse inhibition paradigm. A moderately intense prepulse tone, that suppresses startle response to a strong auditory stimulus, elicited a significantly stronger effect in fragile X than in control mice. Second, sensory hyperreactivity of fragile X mice was demonstrated by a high seizure susceptibility to auditory stimulation. Selective induction of c-Fos, an early-immediate gene product, indicated that seizures involve auditory brainstem and thalamic nuclei. Audiogenic seizures were not due to a general increase in brain excitability because three different chemical convulsants (kainic acid, bicuculline and pentylenetetrazole) elicited similar effects in fragile X and wild-type mice. These data are consistent with the increased responsiveness of fragile X patients to auditory stimuli. The auditory hypersensitivity suggests an abnormal processing in the auditory system of fragile X mice, which could provide a useful model to study the molecular and cellular changes underlying fragile X syndrome. © 2001 IBRO.},

Inactivation of the mouse gene Fmr1 confers a number of FXS-like phenotypes including an enhanced susceptibility to epileptogenesis during development. We find that in a FXS mouse model, in which the function of FMRP is suppressed, synaptically released glutamate induced prolonged epileptiform discharges resulting from enhanced group I metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-mediated responses in hippocampal slices. The induction of the group I mGluR-mediated, prolonged epileptiform discharges was inhibited in preparations that were pretreated with inhibitors of ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2) phosphorylation or of mRNA translation, and their maintenance was suppressed by group I mGluR antagonists. The results suggest that FMRP plays a key role in the control of signaling at the recurrent glutamatergic synapses in the hippocampus. The absence of this control causes the synaptically activated group I mGluRs to elicit translation-dependent epileptogenic activities.},

abstract = {Cortical maps in sensory cortices are plastic, changing in response to sensory experience. The cellular site of such plasticity is currently debated. Thalamocortical (TC) projections deliver sensory information to sensory cortices. TC synapses are currently dismissed as a locus of cortical map plasticity because TC synaptic plasticity is thought to be limited to neonates, whereas cortical map plasticity can be induced in both neonates and adults. However, in the auditory cortex (ACx) of adults, cortical map plasticity can be induced if animals attend to a sound or receive sounds paired with activation of cholinergic inputs from the nucleus basalis. We now show that, in the ACx, long-term potentiation (LTP), a major form of synaptic plasticity, is expressed at TC synapses in both young and mature mice but becomes gated with age. Using single-cell electrophysiology, two-photon glutamate uncaging, and optogenetics in TC slices containing the auditory thalamus and ACx, we show that TC LTP is expressed postsynaptically and depends on group I metabotropic glutamate receptors. TC LTP in mature ACx can be unmasked by cortical disinhibition combined with activation of cholinergic inputs from the nucleus basalis. Cholinergic inputs passing through the thalamic radiation activate M1 muscarinic receptors on TC projections and sustain glutamate release at TC synapses via negative regulation of presynaptic adenosine signaling through A1 adenosine receptors. These data indicate that TC LTP in the ACx persists throughout life and therefore can potentially contribute to experience-dependent cortical map plasticity in the ACx in both young and adult animals.},

The underlying impact of these changes on the emergence of maternal behaviors and sensory processing within the mother's brain are largely unknown. By using in vivo cell-attached recordings in the primary auditory cortex of female mice, we discovered that exposure to pups' body odor reshapes neuronal responses to pure tones and natural auditory stimuli. This olfactory-auditory interaction appeared naturally in lactating mothers shortly after parturition and was long lasting. Naive virgins that had experience with the pups also showed an appearance of olfactory-auditory integration in A1, suggesting that multisensory integration may be experience dependent. Neurons from lactating mothers were more sensitive to sounds as compared to those from experienced mice, independent of the odor effects. These uni- and multisensory cortical changes may facilitate the detection and discrimination of pup distress calls and strengthen the bond between mothers and their neonates.

This study determined the effects of habituation on the RF of neurons in the auditory cortex of the guinea pig (Cavia porcellus). One frequency was presented repeatedly (REP) followed by redetermination of the RF. After REP, 26/36 (72\%) RFs exhibited a substantial reduction (70-75\%) of response to the repeated frequency, and this was highly specific (bandwidth less than 0.125 octave). This RF plasticity involves an initial decrease in response during REP but does not require attenuated responses at the end of REP. Incubation (i.e., development over time after cessation of REP) and long-term frequency-specific effects are evident. Thus, habituation induces a specific change in the processing of frequency information rather than a general reduction in responsivity.},

In hippocampus, LTD requires activation of postsynaptic NMDA receptors, PKA, and the clathrin-dependent endocytosis of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors. It has long been assumed that LTD induced in visual cortical layer 2/3 by LFS of layer 4 uses similar mechanisms. Here we show in mouse visual cortex that this conclusion requires revision. We find that LTD induced in layer 2/3 by LFS is unaffected by inhibitors of PKA or alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor endocytosis but is reliably blocked by an endocannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist. Conversely, LFS applied to synapses on layer 4 neurons produces LTD that appears mechanistically identical to that in CA1 and is insensitive to CB1 blockers. Occlusion experiments suggest that both mechanisms contribute to the loss of visual responsiveness after monocular deprivation.},

Cortical pyramidal neurons in affected individuals and Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mice have an increased density of dendritic spines. The mutant mice also show defects in synaptic and experience-dependent circuit plasticity, which are known to be mediated in part by dendritic spine dynamics. We used in vivo time-lapse imaging with two-photon microscopy through cranial windows in male and female neonatal mice to test the hypothesis that dynamics of dendritic protrusions are altered in KO mice during early postnatal development. We find that layer 2/3 neurons from wild-type mice exhibit a rapid decrease in dendritic spine dynamics during the first 2 postnatal weeks, as immature filopodia are replaced by mushroom spines. In contrast, KO mice show a developmental delay in the downregulation of spine turnover and in the transition from immature to mature spine subtypes. Blockade of metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) signaling, which reverses some adult phenotypes of KO mice, accentuated this immature protrusion phenotype in KO mice. Thus, absence of FMRP delays spine stabilization and dysregulated mGluR signaling in FXS may partially normalize this early synaptic defect.},

The phenotype of FXS is reproduced in fragile X mental retardation 1 (fmr1) knockout (KO) mice that have region-specific altered expression of some gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptor subunits. However, little is known about the characteristics of GABAergic inhibition in the subiculum of these animals. We employed patch-clamp recordings from subicular pyramidal cells in an in vitro slice preparation. In addition, semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot experiments were performed on subiculum obtained from wild-type (WT) and KO mice. We found that tonic GABA(A) currents were downregulated in fmr1 KO compared with WT neurons, whereas no significant differences were observed in phasic GABA(A) currents. Molecular biology analysis revealed that the tonic GABA(A) receptor subunits alpha5 and delta were underexpressed in the fmr1 KO mouse subiculum compared with WT. Because the subiculum plays a role in both cognitive functions and epileptic disorders, we propose that altered tonic inhibition in this structure contributes to the behavioral deficits and epileptic activity seen in FXS patients. This conclusion is in line with evidence implicating tonic GABA(A) inhibition in learning and memory.},

abstract = {The precise regulation of neural excitability is essential for proper nerve cell, neural circuit, and nervous system function. During postembryonic development and throughout life, neurons are challenged with perturbations that can alter excitability, including changes in cell size, innervation, and synaptic input. Numerous experiments demonstrate that neurons are able to compensate for these types of perturbation and maintain appropriate levels of excitation. The mechanisms of compensation are diverse, including regulated changes to synaptic size, synaptic strength, and ion channel function in the plasma membrane. These data are evidence for homeostatic regulatory systems that control neural excitability. A model of neural homeostasis suggests that information about cell activity, cell size, and innervation is fed into a system of cellular monitors. Intracellular- and intercellular-signaling systems transduce this information into regulated changes in synaptic and ion channel function. This review discusses evidence for such a model of homeostatic regulation in the nervous system.},

We found that rearing rats in the presence of a spectrally limited noise band resulted in the closure of the critical period for A1 sectors representing the noise-free spectral bands, whereas the critical period appeared to remain open in noise-exposed sectors, where the cortex was still functionally and physically immature.},

abstract = {Lack of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) causes Fragile X Syndrome, the most common form of inherited mental retardation. FMRP is an RNA-binding protein and is a component of messenger ribonucleoprotein complexes, associated with brain polyribosomes, including dendritic polysomes. FMRP is therefore thought to be involved in translational control of specific mRNAs at synaptic sites. In mice lacking FMRP, protein synthesis-dependent synaptic plasticity is altered and structural malformations of dendritic protrusions occur. One hypothesized cause of the disease mechanism is based on exaggerated group I mGluR receptor activation. In this study, we examined the effect of the mGluR5 antagonist MPEP on Fragile X related behavior in Fmr1 KO mice. Our results demonstrate a clear defect in prepulse inhibition of startle in Fmr1 KO mice, that could be rescued by MPEP. Moreover, we show for the first time a structural rescue of Fragile X related protrusion morphology with two independent mGluR5 antagonists. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.},

How auditory neurons code sound level over such a range is unclear; firing rates of individual neurons increase with sound level over only a very limited portion of the full range of hearing. We show that neurons in the auditory midbrain of the guinea pig adjust their responses to the mean, variance and more complex statistics of sound level distributions. We demonstrate that these adjustments improve the accuracy of the neural population code close to the region of most commonly occurring sound levels. This extends the range of sound levels that can be accurately encoded, fine-tuning hearing to the local acoustic environment.},

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifty-three normal-hearing young Caucasian adults were subjected to two 4-minute sessions in an anechoic sound chamber. In the first session the chamber was empty; in the second session the chamber contained a nonfunctioning loudspeaker. At the end of each session, subjects had to indicate which sounds they perceived from a list of 23 different sounds. RESULTS: When the loudspeaker was not present, 83 percent of the participants reported that they experienced at least one sound, and the percentage increased to 92 percent when the loudspeaker was present. CONCLUSION: These results confirm the emergence of tinnituslike perceptions in a nonclinical population in a silent environment and indicate that suggestive mechanisms play only a minor role in their generation.},

abstract = {Fragile X syndrome is produced by a defect in a single X-linked gene, called Fmr1, and is characterized by abnormal dendritic spine morphologies with spines that are longer and thinner in neocortex than those from age-matched controls. Studies using Fmr1 knockout mice indicate that spine abnormalities are especially pronounced in the first month of life, suggesting that altered developmental plasticity underlies some of the behavioral phenotypes associated with the syndrome. To address this issue, we used intracellular recordings in neocortical slices from early postnatal mice to examine the effects of Fmr1 disruption on two forms of plasticity active during development. One of these, long-term potentiation of intrinsic excitability, is intrinsic in expression and requires mGluR5 activation. The other, spike timing-dependent plasticity, is synaptic in expression and requires N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activation. While intrinsic plasticity was normal in the knockout mice, synaptic plasticity was altered in an unusual and striking way: long-term depression was robust but long-term potentiation was entirely absent. These findings underscore the ideas that Fmr1 has highly selective effects on plasticity and that abnormal postnatal development is an important component of the disorder.},

abstract = {The mechanisms underlying experience-dependent plasticity and refinement of central circuits are not yet fully understood. A non-Hebbian form of synaptic plasticity, which scales synaptic strengths up or down to stabilize firing rates, has recently been discovered in cultured neuronal networks. Here we demonstrate the existence of a similar mechanism in the intact rodent visual cortex. The frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in principal neurons increased steeply between post-natal days 12 and 23. There was a concomitant decrease in mEPSC amplitude, which was prevented by rearing rats in complete darkness from 12 days of age. In addition, as little as two days of monocular deprivation scaled up mEPSC amplitude in a layer- and age-dependent manner. These data indicate that mEPSC amplitudes can be globally scaled up or down as a function of development and sensory experience, and suggest that synaptic scaling may be involved in the activity-dependent refinement of cortical connectivity.},

abstract = {Early in life, neural circuits are highly susceptible to outside influences. The organization of the primary auditory cortex (A1) in particular is governed by acoustic experience during the critical period, an epoch near the beginning of postnatal development throughout which cortical synapses and networks are especially plastic. This neonatal sensitivity to the pattern of sensory inputs is believed to be essential for constructing stable and adequately adapted representations of the auditory world and for the acquisition of language skills by children. One important principle of synaptic organization in mature brains is the balance between excitation and inhibition, which controls receptive field structure and spatiotemporal flow of neural activity, but it is unknown how and when this excitatory-inhibitory balance is initially established and calibrated. Here we use whole-cell recording to determine the processes underlying the development of synaptic receptive fields in rat A1. We find that, immediately after the onset of hearing, sensory-evoked excitatory and inhibitory responses are equally strong, although inhibition is less stimulus-selective and mismatched with excitation. However, during the third week of postnatal development, excitation and inhibition become highly correlated. Patterned sensory stimulation drives coordinated synaptic changes across receptive fields, rapidly improves excitatory-inhibitory coupling and prevents further exposure-induced modifications. Thus, the pace of cortical synaptic receptive field development is set by progressive, experience-dependent refinement of intracortical inhibition.},

abstract = {The goal of this review is to give a detailed description of the main results obtained in the field of learning-induced plasticity. The review is focused on receptive field and map changes observed in the auditory, somatosensory and visual thalamo-cortical systems as a result of an associative training performed in waking animals. Receptive field (RF) plasticity, 2DG and map changes obtained in the auditory and somatosensory system are reviewed. In the visual system, as there is no RF and map analysis during learning per se, the evidence presented are from increased neuronal responsiveness, and from the effects of perceptual learning in human and non human primates. Across sensory modalities, the re-tuning of neurons to a significant stimulus or map reorganizations in favour of the significant stimuli were observed at the thalamic and/or cortical level. The analysis of the literature in each sensory modality indicates that relationships between learning-induced sensory plasticity and behavioural performance can, or cannot, be found depending on the tasks that were used. The involvement (i) of Hebbian synaptic plasticity in the described neuronal changes and (ii) of neuro-modulators as 'gating' factors of the neuronal changes, is evaluated. The weakness of the Hebbian schema to explain learning-induced changes and the need to better define what the word 'learning' means are stressed. It is suggested that future research should focus on the dynamic of information processing in sensory systems, and the concept of 'effective connectivity' should be useful in that matter.},

OBJECTIVES: To review animal and human studies related to neural correlates of tinnitus. Among those are increased spontaneous firing rate, enhanced neural synchrony, and reorganization of the cortical frequency-place (tonotopic) map. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To separate these issues one would want to have a situation where hearing loss is present but without reorganization of the cortical frequency-place map. For that purpose, noise-exposed cats were placed, immediately after the trauma and for at least 3 weeks, either in a quiet or in a high-frequency or low-frequency enriched acoustic environment. RESULTS: In exposed cats that were placed in the quiet environment there was an increase in spontaneous firing rate and synchrony of neurons in primary auditory cortex. In contrast, exposed cats placed in the high-frequency-enriched acoustic environment did not show any significant difference in spontaneous firing rate or synchrony compared to the non-traumatized controls.},

abstract = {The fragile X mental retardation syndrome is due to the transcriptional silence of the fragile X gene, FMR1, and to the resulting loss of the FMR1 product, FMRP. The pathogenesis of the syndrome, however, is not understood. Increased prevalence of childhood seizures is a feature of the fragile X syndrome and increased seizure susceptibility is seen in the fragile X knock out mouse model for this disorder. To investigate the increased seizure susceptibility, we examined GABA(A) receptor expression in the FVB/N fragile X mouse. Western blot analysis revealed that expression of the GABA(A) receptor beta subunit (GABA(A) beta), which is required for receptor function, was reduced in the cortex, hippocampus, diencephalon and brainstem in adult male fragile X mice. Immunohistochemical analysis of brain sections indicated a reduction in GABA(A) beta immunoreactivity. We also found increased expression of glutamic acid decarboxylase, the enzyme responsible for GABA synthesis, in the same regions that showed GABA(A) beta reduction. These results indicate that the absence of Fmrp leads to GABAergic system alterations that could account for the increased seizure susceptibility of the fragile X mouse. These alterations may also be relevant to the seizures and the abnormal behaviors in the human syndrome.},

abstract = {Over the last 50 yr, environmental enrichment has been shown to generate more than a dozen changes in brain anatomy. The consequences of these physical changes on information processing have not been well studied. In this study, rats were housed in enriched or standard conditions either prior to or after reaching sexual maturity. Evoked potentials from awake rats and extracellular recordings from anesthetized rats were used to document responses of auditory cortex neurons. This report details several significant, new findings about the influence of housing conditions on the responses of rat auditory cortex neurons. First, enrichment dramatically increases the strength of auditory cortex responses. Tone-evoked potentials of enriched rats, for example, were more than twice the amplitude of rats raised in standard laboratory conditions. Second, cortical responses of both young and adult animals benefit from exposure to an enriched environment and are degraded by exposure to an impoverished environment. Third, housing condition resulted in rapid remodeling of cortical responses in <2 wk. Fourth, recordings made under anesthesia indicate that enrichment increases the number of neurons activated by any sound. This finding shows that the evoked potential plasticity documented in awake rats was not due to differences in behavioral state. Finally, enrichment made primary auditory cortex (A1) neurons more sensitive to quiet sounds, more selective for tone frequency, and altered their response latencies. These experiments provide the first evidence of physiologic changes in auditory cortex processing resulting from generalized environmental enrichment.},

Fifteen adults with bilateral high-frequency tinnitus but normal hearing at standard frequencies and seventeen matched controls without tinnitus were tested. The psychoacoustic characteristics of the tinnitus spectrum (pitch and loudness) were assessed using novel participant-directed custom-made methods. The startle task consisted of startle-alone, prepulse inhibition and gap-in-noise condition at low- and high-background noise frequencies. All measurements were retested after several months. Data indicate normal prepulse inhibition but higher reactivity to the startle sounds in the tinnitus group in comparison with controls. Most importantly, the tinnitus group displayed a consistent deficit in gap processing at both low- and high-background noise frequencies. All effects were identified consistently and were reproducible at retest. We propose that the higher reactivity to startle might reflect hyperacusis and that the gap deficit might be an index of abnormal cortical auditory processing in tinnitus. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Although rapid-onset, short-term regulation of neuronal Ca currents by neurotransmitters and second messengers is well documented, little is known about conditions that can cause longer-lasting changes in Ca channel function. We report here that persistent depolarization is accompanied by slowly developing long-term reduction of neuronal Ca currents. Rat myenteric neurons grown in cell culture for 1-7 d were studied with the tight-seal whole-cell recording technique. Macroscopic Ca-channel currents had decaying and sustained components at all days studied. When the neurons were grown in medium containing 25 mM KCl, which depolarized them to -40 mV and caused significant elevation of intracellular Ca, the densities of both components of Ca-channel current decreased by 40-80\%. Several results suggest that different mechanisms underlie the downregulation of the two components. (1) The density of the decaying component decreased approximately four times faster than did that of the sustained component. (2) When neurons were returned to control medium, which contained 5 mM KCl, the density of the sustained component returned to control levels within 24 hr, while that of the decaying component did not recover significantly. (3) Inhibitors of RNA and protein synthesis reduced or prevented downregulation of the sustained but not of the decaying component. (4) The dihydropyridine antagonist nitrendipine, which prevented the sustained elevation of intracellular Ca in neurons grown in 25 mM KCl, prevented downregulation of the sustained component but had no effect on downregulation of the decaying component. We suggest that these forms of regulation of Ca current density could help neurons adapt to altered levels of electrical activity and may contribute to changes in synaptic strength that occur during periods of increased or decreased electrical activity.},

We find that monocular deprivation (MD) induces two separate modifications: (1) rapid, deprivation-induced response depression and (2) delayed, deprivation-enabled, experience-dependent response potentiation. To gain insight into how altering retinal activity triggers these cortical responses, we compared the effects of MD by lid closure with monocular inactivation (MI) by intravitreal injection of tetrodotoxin. We find that MI fails to induce deprived-eye response depression but promotes potentiation of responses driven by the normal eye. These effects of MI in juvenile mice closely resemble the effects of MD in adult mice. Understanding how MI and MD differentially affect activity in the visual system of young mice may provide key insight into how the critical period ends.},

abstract = {We investigated the hypothesis that task performance can rapidly and adaptively reshape cortical receptive field properties in accord with specific task demands and salient sensory cues. We recorded neuronal responses in the primary auditory cortex of behaving ferrets that were trained to detect a target tone of any frequency. Cortical plasticity was quantified by measuring focal changes in each cell's spectrotemporal response field (STRF) in a series of passive and active behavioral conditions. STRF measurements were made simultaneously with task performance, providing multiple snapshots of the dynamic STRF during ongoing behavior. Attending to a specific target frequency during the detection task consistently induced localized facilitative changes in STRF shape, which were swift in onset. Such modulatory changes may enhance overall cortical responsiveness to the target tone and increase the likelihood of 'capturing' the attended target during the detection task. Some receptive field changes persisted for hours after the task was over and hence may contribute to long-term sensory memory.},

abstract = {Receptive fields of sensory cortical neurons are plastic, changing in response to alterations of neural activity or sensory experience. In this way, cortical representations of the sensory environment can incorporate new information about the world, depending on the relevance or value of particular stimuli. Neuromodulation is required for cortical plasticity, but it is uncertain how subcortical neuromodulatory systems, such as the cholinergic nucleus basalis, interact with and refine cortical circuits. Here we determine the dynamics of synaptic receptive field plasticity in the adult primary auditory cortex (also known as AI) using in vivo whole-cell recording. Pairing sensory stimulation with nucleus basalis activation shifted the preferred stimuli of cortical neurons by inducing a rapid reduction of synaptic inhibition within seconds, which was followed by a large increase in excitation, both specific to the paired stimulus. Although nucleus basalis was stimulated only for a few minutes, reorganization of synaptic tuning curves progressed for hours thereafter: inhibition slowly increased in an activity-dependent manner to rebalance the persistent enhancement of excitation, leading to a retuned receptive field with new preference for the paired stimulus. This restricted period of disinhibition may be a fundamental mechanism for receptive field plasticity, and could serve as a memory trace for stimuli or episodes that have acquired new behavioural significance.},

abstract = {Slow periodic EEG discharges are common in CNS disorders. The pathophysiology of this aberrant rhythmic activity is poorly understood. We used a computational model of a neocortical network with a dynamic homeostatic scaling rule to show that loss of input (partial deafferentation) can trigger network reorganization that results in pathological periodic discharges. The decrease in average firing rate in the network by deafferentation was compensated by homeostatic synaptic scaling of recurrent excitation among pyramidal cells. Synaptic scaling succeeded in recovering the network target firing rate for all degrees of deafferentation (fraction of deafferented cells), but there was a critical degree of deafferentation for pathological network reorganization. For deafferentation degrees below this value, homeostatic upregulation of recurrent excitation had minimal effect on the macroscopic network dynamics. For deafferentation above this threshold, however, a slow periodic oscillation appeared, patterns of activity were less sparse, and bursting occurred in individual neurons. Also, comparison of spike-triggered afferent and recurrent excitatory conductances revealed that information transmission was strongly impaired. These results suggest that homeostatic plasticity can lead to secondary functional impairment in case of cortical disorders associated with cell loss.},

This asynchronous pairing induced rapid modifications of intracortical connections and shifts in receptive fields. These changes depended on the temporal order and interval between visual stimuli in a manner consistent with spike timing-dependent synaptic plasticity.

abstract = {In the big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, the response properties of neurons and the cochleotopic (frequency) maps in the auditory cortex (AC) and inferior colliculus can be changed by auditory conditioning, weak focal electric stimulation of the AC, or repetitive delivery of weak, short tone bursts. The corticofugal system plays an important role in information processing and plasticity in the auditory system. Our present findings are as follows. In the AC, best frequency (BF) shifts, i.e., reorganization of a frequency map, slowly develop and reach a plateau approximately 180 min after conditioning with tone bursts and electric-leg stimulation. The plateau lasts more than 26 h. In the inferior colliculus, on the other hand, BF shifts rapidly develop and become the largest at the end of a 30-min-long conditioning session. The shifted BFs return (i. e., recover) to normal in approximately 180 min. The collicular BF shifts are not a consequence of the cortical BF shifts. Instead, they lead the cortical BF shifts. The collicular BF shifts evoked by conditioning are very similar to the collicular and cortical BF shifts evoked by cortical electrical stimulation. Therefore, our working hypothesis is that, during conditioning, the corticofugal system evokes subcortical BF shifts, which in turn boost cortical BF shifts. The cortical BF shifts otherwise would be very small. However, whether the cortical BF shifts are consequently boosted depends on nonauditory systems, including nonauditory sensory cortices, amygdala, basal forebrain, etc., which determine the behavioral relevance of acoustic stimuli.},

abstract = {Despite the pronounced neurological deficits associated with mental retardation and autism, it is unknown if altered neocortical circuit function occurs in these prevalent disorders. Here we demonstrate specific alterations in local synaptic connections, membrane excitability, and circuit activity of defined neuron types in sensory neocortex of the mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome-the Fmr1 knockout (KO). Overall, these alterations result in hyperexcitability of neocortical circuits in the Fmr1 KO. Specifically, we observe a substantial deficit in local excitatory drive (approximately 50\%) targeting fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory neurons in layer 4 of somatosensory, barrel cortex. This persists until at least 4 wk of age suggesting it may be permanent. In contrast, monosynaptic GABAergic synaptic transmission was u naffected. Overall, these changes indicate that local feedback inhibition in neocortical layer 4 is severely impaired in the Fmr1 KO mouse. An increase in the intrinsic membrane excitability of excitatory neurons may further contribute to hyperexcitability of cortical networks. In support of this idea, persistent neocortical circuit activity, or UP states, elicited by thalamic stimulation was longer in duration in the Fmr1 KO mouse. In addition, network inhibition during the UP state was less synchronous, including a 14\% decrease in synchrony in the gamma frequency range (30-80 Hz). These circuit changes may be involved in sensory stimulus hypersensitivity, epilepsy, and cognitive impairment associated with Fragile X and autism.},

abstract = {It is well established that sensory cortices of animals can be modified by sensory experience, especially during a brief early critical period in development. Theoretical analyses indicate that there are two synaptic plasticity mechanisms required: input-specific synaptic modifications and global homeostatic mechanisms to provide stability to neural networks. Experience-dependent homeostatic synaptic plasticity mechanisms have subsequently been demonstrated in the visual cortex of juvenile animals. Here, we report that experience-dependent homeostatic synaptic plasticity persists through adulthood in the superficial layers of the mouse visual cortex. We found that 2 d of visual deprivation in the form of dark rearing is necessary and sufficient to cause an increase in AMPA receptor-mediated miniature EPSC amplitude in layer 2/3 neurons. This increase was rapidly reversed by 1 d of light exposure. This reversible change in synaptic strength persisted in adult mice past the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity, which is reported to end at approximately 1 month of age in rodents. Interestingly, the mechanism of homeostatic synaptic modifications in 3-month-old mice differed from that in young mice (3 weeks old) in that the multiplicative nature of synaptic scaling is lost. Our results demonstrate that the superficial layers of adult mouse visual cortex retain the ability to undergo reversible experience-dependent homeostatic synaptic plasticity.},

Mouse pups are also highly vocal, producing isolation vocalizations when they are cold or removed from the nest. This study examined patterns in the development of pup isolation vocalizations, and compared these to adult vocalizations. In three litters of CBA/CaJ mice, we recorded isolation vocalizations at ages postnatal day 5 (p5), p7, p9, p11, and p13. Adult vocalizations were obtained in a variety of social situations. Altogether, 28,384 discrete vocal signals were recorded using high-frequency-sensitive equipment and analyzed for syllable type, spectral and temporal features, and the temporal sequencing within bouts. We found that pups produced all but one of the 11 syllable types recorded from adults. The proportions of syllable types changed developmentally, but even the youngest pups produced complex syllables with frequency-time variations. When all syllable types were pooled together for analysis, changes in the peak frequency or the duration of syllables were small, although significant, from p5 through p13. However, individual syllable types showed different, large patterns of change over development, requiring analysis of each syllable type separately. Most adult syllables were substantially lower in frequency and shorter in duration. As pups aged, the complexity of vocal bouts increased, with a greater tendency to switch between syllable types. Vocal bouts from older animals, p13 and adult, had significantly more sequential structure than those from younger mice. Overall, these results demonstrate substantial changes in social vocalizations with age. Future studies are required to identify whether these changes result from developmental processes affecting the vocal tract or control of vocalization, or from vocal learning. To provide a tool for further research, we developed a MATLAB program that generates bouts of vocalizations that correspond to mice of different ages.},

It has been recently shown that mGluR1 is involved in corticostriatal long-term depression, by means of pharmacological approach and by using mGluR1-knockout mice. Here, we report that both mGluR1 and mGluR5 are involved in corticostriatal long-term potentiation (LTP). In particular, the mGluR1 antagonist LY 367385, as well as the mGluR5 antagonist MPEP, reduce LTP amplitude. Moreover, blockade of both mGluR1 and mGluR5 by LY 367385 and MPEP co-administration fully suppresses LTP. Accordingly, group II and group III mGluRs antagonists fail to affect LTP induction. Interestingly, LTP amplitude is also significantly reduced in both mGluR1- and mGluR5-knockout mice. The differential function of mGluR1 and mGluR5 in corticostriatal synaptic plasticity may play a role in the modulation of the motor activity mediated by the basal ganglia, thus providing a substrate for the pharmacological treatment of motor disorders involving the striatum. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Topographically organized maps of the sensory receptor epithelia are regarded as cornerstones of cortical organization as well as valuable readouts of diverse biological processes ranging from evolution to neural plasticity. However, maps are most often derived from multiunit activity recorded in the thalamic input layers of anesthetized animals using near-threshold stimuli. Less distinct topography has been described by studies that deviated from the formula above, which brings into question the generality of the principle. Here, we explicitly compared the strength of tonotopic organization at various depths within core and belt regions of the auditory cortex using electrophysiological measurements ranging from single units to delta-band local field potentials (LFP) in the awake and anesthetized mouse. Unit recordings in the middle cortical layers revealed a precise tonotopic organization in core, but not belt, regions of auditory cortex that was similarly robust in awake and anesthetized conditions. In core fields, tonotopy was degraded outside the middle layers or when LFP signals were substituted for unit activity, due to an increasing proportion of recording sites with irregular tuning for pure tones. However, restricting our analysis to clearly defined receptive fields revealed an equivalent tonotopic organization in all layers of the cortical column and for LFP activity ranging from gamma to theta bands. Thus, core fields represent a transition between topographically organized simple receptive field arrangements that extend throughout all layers of the cortical column and the emergence of nontonotopic representations outside the input layers that are further elaborated in the belt fields.},

During this period, cortical sensory neurons may shift their response selectivity and become tuned to more frequently occurring stimuli. Although this enlarged cortical representation is believed to underlie improved sensory processing of the experienced stimuli, its precise perceptual consequences are still unknown. We show that rearing rats in a single-frequency tonal environment results in enlarged cortical representations of the frequencies near that of the experienced tone, but the animals are impaired in perceptual discrimination of the over-represented frequencies. By contrast, discrimination of the neighboring under-represented frequencies is substantially improved. Computational analysis indicated that the altered perceptual ability could be fully accounted for by the sound exposure-induced reorganization of cortical primary auditory representations. These results indicate that early experience shapes sensory perception. The same plasticity processes may be important in optimizing phonemic representations in humans.},

abstract = {The language characteristics of fra(X) males (n = 10) with an IQ greater than or equal to 70 were evaluated. Language testing demonstrated relatively stronger receptive vocabulary skills compared to weak auditory memory and processing skills. A characteristic speech and language disturbance, cluttering, was present in 9 of the 10 study patients. Their speech was characterized by a fast and fluctuating rate of speech, and repetitions of sounds, words or phrases. Other aspects of cluttering including attentional problems, hyperactivity, motor delays and reading difficulties are commonly seen in the fra(X) syndrome. Cluttering may be helpful in identifying the fra(X) syndrome in a male who is not retarded.},

abstract = {Alterations in sensory processing constitute prominent symptoms of fragile X syndrome; however, little is known about how disrupted synaptic and circuit development in sensory cortex contributes to these deficits. To investigate how the loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) impacts the development of cortical synapses, we examined excitatory thalamocortical synapses in somatosensory cortex during the perinatal critical period in Fmr1 knockout mice. FMRP ablation resulted in dysregulation of glutamatergic signaling maturation. The fraction of silent synapses persisting to later developmental times was increased; there was a temporal delay in the window for synaptic plasticity, while other forms of developmental plasticity were not altered in Fmr1 knockout mice. Our results indicate that FMRP is required for the normal developmental progression of synaptic maturation, and loss of this important RNA binding protein impacts the timing of the critical period for layer IV synaptic plasticity.},

Here we use chronic multielectrode recordings to monitor firing rates in visual cortex of freely behaving rats during chronic monocular visual deprivation (MD). Firing rates in V1 were suppressed over the first 2 day of MD but then rebounded to baseline over the next 2-3 days despite continued MD. This drop and rebound in firing was accompanied by bidirectional changes in mEPSC amplitude measured ex vivo. The rebound in firing was independent of sleep-wake state but was cell type specific, as putative FS and regular spiking neurons responded to MD with different time courses. These data establish that homeostatic mechanisms within the intact CNS act to stabilize neuronal firing rates in the face of sustained sensory perturbations.},

The ability to control the timing, duration, and closure of these heightened levels of brain plasticity has recently become experimentally accessible, especially in the developing visual system. This review summarizes our current understanding of known critical periods across several systems and species. It delineates a number of emerging principles: functional competition between inputs, role for electrical activity, structural consolidation, regulation by experience (not simply age), special role for inhibition in the CNS, potent influence of attention and motivation, unique timing and duration, as well as use of distinct molecular mechanisms across brain regions and the potential for reactivation in adulthood. A deeper understanding of critical periods will open new avenues to "nurture the brain"-from international efforts to link brain science and education to improving recovery from injury and devising new strategies for therapy and lifelong learning.},

Golgi analysis of neocortical dendritic spine morphology extended our previous observations of immature, long, tortuous spines in one adult case of fraX (Rudelli, et al., Acta Neuropathologica 67:289-295, 1985) to 2 new cases. Evidence for similar dendritic spine abnormalities was found, although Golgi analysis was less than optimal because of incomplete dendritic stain impregnation. Neocortical intra-layer cell density was also investigated in all 3 cases. Cresyl violet stained neurons were counted in 10 randomly selected fields in neocortical layers II-VI of cingulate and temporal association areas (Brodmann's areas 23 and 38). Neuron counts in fraX and control neocortex showed no significant differences. Thus, abnormal dendritic spine morphology with preservation of neuronal density appears to characterize the neocortex in individuals with this common form of mental retardation.},

Here we examined the influence of pulsed noise experience on the development of sound representations in the primary auditory cortex (AI) of the rat. In na\"{\i}ve animals, FM sweep direction selectivity depends on the characteristic frequency (CF) of the neuron--low CF neurons tend to select for upward sweeps and high CF neurons for downward sweeps. Such a CF dependence was not observed in animals that had received weeklong exposure to pulsed noise in periods from postnatal day 8 (P8) to P15 or from P24 to P39. In addition, AI tonotopicity, tuning bandwidth, intensity threshold, tone-responsiveness, and sweep response magnitude were differentially affected by the noise experience depending on the exposure time windows. These results are consistent with previous findings of feature-dependent multiple sensitive periods. The different effects induced here by pulsed noise and previously by FM sweeps further indicate that plasticity in cortical complex sound representations is specific to the sensory input.},

After monocular visual deprivation, the reduction in response of binocular neurons to one eye is matched by a corresponding increase to the other. Chronic optical imaging in mice deficient in TNF$\alpha$ reveals the normal initial loss of deprived-eye responses, but the subsequent increase in response to the open eye is absent. This mutation also blocks homeostatic synaptic scaling of mEPSCs in visual cortex in vitro, without affecting LTP. In monocular cortex, thought not to be subject to competition, responses in TNF$\alpha$ mutants are as reduced as in the binocular zone. Pharmacological inhibition of endogenous TNF$\alpha$ in wild-type mice phenocopies the knockout. These findings suggest that experience-dependent competition in developing visual cortex is the outcome of two distinct, noncompetitive processes, a loss of deprived-eye responses followed by an apparently homeostatic increase in responses dependent on TNF$\alpha$ signaling. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Exposure to sounds during early development causes enlarged cortical representations of those sounds, leading to the commonly held view that the size of stimulus representations increases with stimulus exposure. However, representing stimuli based solely on their prevalence may be inefficient, because many frequent environmental sounds are behaviorally irrelevant. Here, we show that cortical plasticity depends not only on exposure time but also on the temporal modulation rate of the stimulus set. We examined cortical plasticity induced by early exposure to 7 kHz tone pips repeated at a slow (2 Hz), fast (15 Hz), or ethological (6 Hz) rate. Certain rat calls are modulated near 6 Hz. We found that spectral representation of 7 kHz increased only in the ethological-rate-reared animals, whereas improved entrainment of cortical neurons was seen in animals reared in the slow- and fast-rate condition. This temporal rate dependence of spectral plasticity may serve as a filtering mechanism to selectively enlarge representations of species-specific vocalizations. Furthermore, our results indicate that spectral and temporal plasticity can be separately engaged depending on the statistical properties of the input stimuli.},

This is due to an increase in both excitatory and inhibitory synapses found on spines. Four days after stimulation, the inhibitory inputs to the spines remain despite total synaptic density returning to pre-stimulation levels. Functional analysis of layer IV cells demonstrated altered response properties, immediately after stimulation, as well as four days later.

abstract = {Developmental hearing impairments compromise sound discrimination, speech acquisition, and cognitive function; however, the adjustments of functional properties in the primary auditory cortex (A1) remain unknown. We induced sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in developing gerbils and then reared the animals for several days. The intrinsic membrane and synaptic properties of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons were subsequently examined in a thalamocortical brain slice preparation with whole-cell recordings and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry. SNHL neurons displayed a depolarized resting membrane potential, an increased input resistance, and a higher incidence of sustained firing. They also exhibited significantly larger thalamocortically and intracortically evoked excitatory synaptic responses, including a greater susceptibility to the NMDA receptor antagonist AP-5 and the NR2B subunit antagonist ifenprodil. This correlated with an increase in NR2B labeling of asymmetric synapses, as visualized ultrastructurally. Furthermore, decreased frequency and increased amplitude of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) in SNHL neurons suggest that a decline in presynaptic release properties is compensated by an increased excitatory response. To verify that the increased thalamocortical excitation was elicited by putative monosynaptic connections, minimum amplitude ventral medial geniculate nucleus-evoked EPSCs were recorded.

abstract = {Developmental hearing impairments compromise sound discrimination, speech acquisition, and cognitive function; however, the adjustments of functional properties in the primary auditory cortex (A1) remain unknown. We induced sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) in developing gerbils and then reared the animals for several days. The intrinsic membrane and synaptic properties of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons were subsequently examined in a thalamocortical brain slice preparation with whole-cell recordings and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry. SNHL neurons displayed a depolarized resting membrane potential, an increased input resistance, and a higher incidence of sustained firing. They also exhibited significantly larger thalamocortically and intracortically evoked excitatory synaptic responses, including a greater susceptibility to the NMDA receptor antagonist AP-5 and the NR2B subunit antagonist ifenprodil. This correlated with an increase in NR2B labeling of asymmetric synapses, as visualized ultrastructurally. Furthermore, decreased frequency and increased amplitude of miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) in SNHL neurons suggest that a decline in presynaptic release properties is compensated by an increased excitatory response. To verify that the increased thalamocortical excitation was elicited by putative monosynaptic connections, minimum amplitude ventral medial geniculate nucleus-evoked EPSCs were recorded. These minimum-evoked responses were of larger amplitude, and the NMDAergic currents were also larger and longer in SNHL neurons. These findings were supported by significantly longer AP-5-sensitive durations and larger amplitudes of mEPSCs. Last, the amplitudes of intracortically evoked monosynaptic and polysynaptic GABAergic inhibitory synaptic responses were significantly smaller in SNHL neurons.

abstract = {The article reviews evidence for sensitive periods in the sensory systems and considers their neuronal mechanisms from the viewpoint of the system's neuroscience. It reviews the essential cortical developmental steps and shows its dependence on experience. It differentiates feature representation and object representation and their neuronal mechanisms. The most important developmental effect of experience is considered to be the transformation of a naive cortical neuronal network into a network capable of categorization, by that establishing auditory objects. The control mechanisms of juvenile and adult plasticity are further discussed. Total absence of hearing experience prevents the patterning of the naive auditory system with subsequent extensive consequences on the auditory function. Additional to developmental changes in synaptic plasticity, other brain functions like corticocortical interareal couplings are also influenced by deprivation. Experiments with deaf auditory systems reveal several integrative effects of deafness and their reversibility with experience. Additional to developmental molecular effects on synaptic plasticity, a combination of several integrative effects of deprivation on brain functions, including feature representation (affecting the starting point for learning), categorization function, top-down interactions and cross-modal reorganization close the sensitive periods and may contribute to their critical nature. Further, non-auditory effects of auditory deprivation are discussed. To reopen critical periods, removal of molecular breaks in synaptic plasticity and focused training therapy on the integrative effects are required.},

@article{Kuhlman2013,
abstract = {Early sensory experience instructs the maturation of neural circuitry in the cortex. This has been studied extensively in the primary visual cortex, in which loss of vision to one eye permanently degrades cortical responsiveness to that eye, a phenomenon known as ocular dominance plasticity (ODP). Cortical inhibition mediates this process, but the precise role of specific classes of inhibitory neurons in ODP is controversial. Here we report that evoked firing rates of binocular excitatory neurons in the primary visual cortex immediately drop by half when vision is restricted to one eye, but gradually return to normal over the following twenty-four hours, despite the fact that vision remains restricted to one eye. This restoration of binocular-like excitatory firing rates after monocular deprivation results from a rapid, although transient, reduction in the firing rates of fast-spiking, parvalbumin-positive (PV) interneurons, which in turn can be attributed to a decrease in local excitatory circuit input onto PV interneurons. This reduction in PV-cell-evoked responses after monocular lid suture is restricted to the critical period for ODP and appears to be necessary for subsequent shifts in excitatory ODP. Pharmacologically enhancing inhibition at the time of sight deprivation blocks ODP and, conversely, pharmacogenetic reduction of PV cell firing rates can extend the critical period for ODP. These findings define the microcircuit changes initiating competitive plasticity during critical periods of cortical development. Moreover, they show that the restoration of evoked firing rates of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons by PV-specific disinhibition is a key step in the progression of ODP.},

Critical periods are regulated by the balance of excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) neurotransmission in the brain during development. There is now increasing evidence of E/I imbalance in autism, a complex genetic neurodevelopmental disorder diagnosed by abnormal socialization, impaired communication, and repetitive behaviors or restricted interests. The underlying cause is still largely unknown and there is no fully effective treatment or cure. We propose that alteration of the expression and/or timing of critical period circuit refinement in primary sensory brain areas may significantly contribute to autistic phenotypes, including cognitive and behavioral impairments. Dissection of the cellular and molecular mechanisms governing well-established critical periods represents a powerful tool to identify new potential therapeutic targets to restore normal plasticity and function in affected neuronal circuits.},

Overexpression of SOD-1 in transgenic (Tg) mice has been used to study the functional roles of this enzyme in oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, and neurotoxicity. We found that Tg-SOD-1 mice are strikingly less sensitive to kainic acid-induced behavioral seizures than control mice. Furthermore, the hippocampus of Tg-SOD-1 mice was far less sensitive to local application of bicuculline, a GABA-A antagonist, than the hippocampus of control mice. GABAergic functions, expressed in extracellular paired-pulse depression, and in IPSCs recorded in dentate granular cells were enhanced in Tg-SOD-1 mice. Finally, long-term potentiation (LTP), not found in the dentate gyrus of Tg-SOD-1 mice, could be restored by local blockade of inhibition and could be blocked in control mice by injection of diazepam, which amplifies inhibition. These results indicate that constitutive elevation of SOD-1 activity exerts a major effect on neuronal excitability in the hippocampus, which, in turn, controls hippocampal ability to express LTP.},

Here we report that the alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate receptor subunit, GluR1, was decreased in the cortical synapses, but not in the hippocampus or cerebellum, of FMR1 gene knockout mice. Reduced long-term potentiation (LTP) was also found in the cortex but not in the hippocampus. Another RNA binding protein, FXR; the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit, NR2; and other learning-related proteins including c-fos, synapsin, myelin proteolipid protein, and cAMP response element binding protein were not different between FMR1 gene knockout and wild-type mice.

abstract = {Neurons in the recipient layers of sensory cortices receive excitatory input from two major sources: the feedforward thalamocortical and recurrent intracortical inputs. To address their respective functional roles, we developed a new method for silencing cortex by competitively activating GABA(A) while blocking GABA(B) receptors. In the rat primary auditory cortex, in vivo whole-cell recording from the same neuron before and after local cortical silencing revealed that thalamic input occupied the same area of frequency-intensity tonal receptive field as the total excitatory input, but showed a flattened tuning curve. In contrast, excitatory intracortical input was sharply tuned with a tuning curve that closely matched that of suprathreshold responses. This can be attributed to a selective amplification of cortical cells' responses at preferred frequencies by intracortical inputs from similarly tuned neurons. Thus, weakly tuned thalamocortical inputs determine the subthreshold responding range, whereas intracortical inputs largely define the tuning. Such circuits may ensure a faithful conveyance of sensory information.},

Developing an ethological model in a genetically manipulable system such as the mouse would enhance the ability to investigate the processing, learning, and recognition of sounds. Characterizing the basic acoustic structure of mouse vocalizations would help lay a foundation for such a future study. Towards this goal, ultrasound vocalizations emitted by isolated mouse pups and pairs of adult males and females have been digitally recorded and examined. Previous work suggests that these calls may have communicative significance. An analysis of the natural variability in their spectral content, median frequency, duration, and repetition period reveals acoustic structure that could be used for recognizing the calls. Other parameters, like the rate of frequency modulation, may also be informative, but have not been examined. Pup isolation calls develop systematically between postnatal day 5 and 12 towards a more stereotyped vocalization--contracting from a wide range of values into narrower clusters of frequency and duration, and shifting from longer to shorter repetition periods. Most significantly, pup isolation and adult encounter calls fall into two distinct spectral and temporal categories, making it possible for a receiver to acoustically distinguish between them, and to potentially categorically perceive them along those dimensions.},

Symptoms of FXS include cognitive disability, hyperactivity, autistic behaviour, seizures and learning deficits. Lithium is a drug used clinically to treat bipolar disorder, and it has been used to treat mood dysregulation in individuals with FXS. We examined whether dietary lithium would alter behavioural and morphological abnormalities in fmr1 knockout (KO) mice. We studied wild-type (WT) and KO mice untreated (control chow) or treated with lithium (0.3\% lithium-carbonate-containing chow) commenced at weaning and maintained throughout the experiment. At age 8-12 wk, mice were subjected to the following behavioural tests: open field, social interaction, elevated plus maze, elevated zero maze and passive avoidance. At 13 wk, brains were prepared for Golgi staining and analysis of dendritic spine morphology in medial prefrontal cortex. We found that compared to untreated WT, untreated KO mice were hyperactive and had reduced anxiety, impaired social interactions, and deficits on a learning test. Dendritic spines in medial prefrontal cortex were longer and increased in number. Lithium treatment ameliorated the hyperactivity and reversed impaired social interaction and deficits on the learning test. Lithium treatment also partially normalized general anxiety levels and dendritic spine morphology. Our findings and those from other laboratories on the efficacy of lithium treatment in animal models support further studies in patients with FXS.},

abstract = {Flavoprotein autofluorescence imaging was used to examine auditory cortical synaptic responses in aged animals with behavioral evidence of tinnitus and hearing loss. Mice were exposed to noise trauma at 1-3 months of age and were assessed for behavioral evidence of tinnitus and hearing loss immediately after the noise trauma and again at \~{}24-30 months of age. Within 2 months of the final behavioral assessment, auditory cortical synaptic transmission was examined in brain slices using electrical stimulation of putative thalamocortical afferents, and flavoprotein autofluorescence imaging was used to measure cortical activation. Noise-exposed animals showed a 68\% increase in amplitude of cortical activation compared with controls (p = 0.008), and these animals showed a diminished sensitivity to GABA(A)ergic blockade (p = 0.008, using bath-applied 200 nm SR 95531 [6-Imino-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1(6H)-p yridazinebutanoic acid hydrobromide]). The strength of cortical activation was significantly correlated to the degree of tinnitus behavior, assessed via a loss of gap detection in a startle paradigm. The decrease in GABA(A) sensitivity was greater in the regions of the cortex farther away from the stimulation site, potentially reflecting a greater sensitivity of corticocortical versus thalamocortical projections to the effects of noise trauma. Finally, there was no relationship between auditory cortical activation and activation of the somatosensory cortex in the same slices, suggesting that the increases in auditory cortical activation were not attributable to a generalized hyperexcitable state in noise-exposed animals. These data suggest that noise trauma can cause long-lasting changes in the auditory cortical physiology and may provide specific targets to ameliorate the effects of chronic tinnitus.},

abstract = {Sensory experience is crucial for shaping the cortical microcircuit during development and is thought to modify network function through several forms of Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity. Where and when these different forms of plasticity are expressed at particular synapse types within cortical microcircuits, and how they interact, is poorly understood. Here we investigated how two different visual deprivation paradigms, lid suture (LS) and intraocular TTX, affect the local microcircuit within layer 2/3 of rat visual cortex during the classical critical period for visual system plasticity. Both forms of visual deprivation produced a compensatory increase in the spontaneous firing of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in acute slices derived from monocular visual cortex. TTX increased spontaneous activity through an increase in the excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance within layer 2/3. In contrast, LS decreased the E/I balance by strongly depressing excitatory transmission, and the homeostatic increase in spontaneous activity was instead achieved through an increase in the intrinsic excitability of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons. The microcircuit in layer 2/3 can thus use different forms of homeostatic plasticity to compensate for the loss of visual drive, depending on the specific demands produced by visual experience. The existence of multiple, partially redundant forms of homeostatic plasticity may ensure that network compensation can be achieved in response to a wide range of sensory perturbations.},

Furthermore, we demonstrate that dfmr1 mutants display cognitive deficits in experience-dependent modification of courtship behavior, and treatment with mGluR antagonists or lithium restores these memory defects. These findings implicate enhanced mGluR signaling as the underlying cause of the cognitive, as well as some of the behavioral and neuronal, phenotypes observed in the Drosophila Fragile X model.

Fragile X syndrome is an X-linked mental retardation with abnormal dendritic protrusions from neurons in the brain. Increased signalling via excitatory metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) pathways is hypothesised to contribute to this disorder. Targeting these receptors has shown improvements in both behaviour and morphology with the Fmr1-KO mouse model for the syndrome. It is not known whether similar changes occur in excitatory synaptic activity following treatment with mGluR antagonists. We tested the effects of prolonged mGluR blockade on excitatory synaptic activity at three developmental time points in hippocampal slices. We observed a rescue effect of the antagonist MPEP upon spontaneous EPSC amplitude and charge at 2. weeks but not 1. week or 8-10. weeks of development. These data support the role of mGluR antagonist treatment for functional synaptic correction at an early developmental stage in a model for fragile X syndrome. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Fragile X syndrome, caused by a mutation in the Fmr1 gene, is characterized by mental retardation. Several studies reported the absence of long-term potentiation (LTP) at neocortical synapses in Fmr1 knockout (FMR1-KO) mice, but underlying cellular mechanisms are unknown. We find that in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of FMR1-KO mice, spike-timing-dependent LTP (tLTP) is not so much absent, but rather, the threshold for tLTP induction is increased. Calcium signaling in dendrites and spines is compromised. First, dendrites and spines more often fail to show calcium transients. Second, the activity of L-type calcium channels is absent in spines. tLTP could be restored by improving reliability and amplitude of calcium signaling by increasing neuronal activity. In FMR1-KO mice that were raised in enriched environments, tLTP was restored to WT levels. Our results show that mechanisms for synaptic plasticity are in place in the FMR1-KO mouse PFC, but require stronger neuronal activity to be triggered. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability. Previous studies have implicated mGlu5 in the pathogenesis of the disease, but a crucial unanswered question is whether pharmacological mGlu5 inhibition is able to reverse an already established FXS phenotype in mammals. Here we have used the novel, potent, and selective mGlu5 inhibitor CTEP to address this issue in the . Fmr1 knockout mouse. Acute CTEP treatment corrects elevated hippocampal long-term depression, protein synthesis, and audiogenic seizures. Chronic treatment that inhibits mGlu5 within a receptor occupancy range of 81\% ± 4\% rescues cognitive deficits, auditory hypersensitivity, aberrant dendritic spine density, overactive ERK and mTOR signaling, and partially corrects macroorchidism. This study shows that a comprehensive phenotype correction in FXS is possible with pharmacological intervention starting in young adulthood, after development of the phenotype. It is of great interest how these findings may translate into ongoing clinical research testing mGlu5 inhibitors in FXS patients. Michalon et al. provide evidence that mGlu5 antagonists have disease-modifying potential for Fragile X syndrome, showing that pharmacological inhibition of mGlu5 in adult mice, after disease onset, corrects a wide spectrum of FXS symptoms in these animals. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Pharmacological studies of the inferior colliculus (IC) suggest that the inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitter ??-aminobutyric acid (GABA) plays an important role in shaping responses to simple and complex acoustic stimuli. Several models of auditory dysfunction, including age-related hearing loss, tinnitus, and peripheral deafferentation, suggest an alteration of normal GABA neurotransmission in central auditory pathways. The present study attempts to further characterize noise-induced changes in GABA markers in the IC. Four groups (unexposed control, 0 h post-exposure, 42 h post-exposure, and 30 days post-exposure) of 3-month-old male Fischer 344 rats were exposed to a high intensity sound (12 kHz, 106 dB) for 10 h. Observed hair cell damage was primarily confined to the basal half of the cochlea. There was a significant decrease in glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD
                        65) immunoreactivity in the IC membrane fraction compared to controls (P < 0.05) at 0 h (-41\%) and 42 h (-28\%) post-exposure, with complete recovery by 30 days post-exposure (P > 0.98). Observed decreases in cytosolic levels of GAD
                        65 were not significant. Quantitative muscimol receptor binding revealed a significant increase (+20\%) in IC 30 days after sound exposure (P < 0.05). These data suggest that changes in GABA neurotransmission occur in the IC of animals exposed to intense sound. Additional studies are needed to determine whether these changes are a result of protective/compensatory mechanisms or merely peripheral differentiation, as well as whether these changes preserve or diminish central auditory system function.

abstract = {The fragile X mutation and fragile X syndrome are associated with hyperarousal, hyperactivity, aggression, and anxiety. These may be related to strong reactions to auditory, tactile, visual, and olfactory stimuli [Hagerman, 1996b; Hagerman and Cronister, 1996]. However, almost no data exist describing hyperarousal and sensory sensitivity in individuals with the fragile X mutation. This study establishes a reliable laboratory paradigm for examining reactions to sensory stimuli. We found the pattern of electrodermal responses (EDRs) to stimulation in one sensory modality predicted the pattern of EDRs in four other sensory systems. In addition, the EDR pattern of individuals with the fragile X mutation was related to their FMR-protein expression. Finally, EDRs in individuals with fragile X syndrome were significantly different from those of normal controls, demonstrating greater magnitude, more responses per stimulation, responses on a greater proportion of trials, and lower rates of habituation. The findings support the theory that individuals with fragile X syndrome have a physiologically based enhancement of reactions to sensations. Because electrodermal activity indexes sympathetic nervous system activity, the data suggest that the over-arousal to sensation may involve the sympathetic system.},

Here we compared the effects of repeated exposure to single-frequency tone pips on cortical and IC frequency representations in juvenile rats. We found that while tone exposure caused a long-lasting increase in cortical representations of the exposure frequency, changes to IC neurons were limited to a transient narrowing of tuning bandwidth.

abstract = {Autism is a neurodevelopmental syndrome with markedly high heritability. The diagnostic indicators of autism are core behavioral symptoms, rather than definitive neuropathological markers. Etiology is thought to involve complex, multigenic interactions and possible environmental contributions. In this review, we focus on genetic pathways with multiple members represented in autism candidate gene lists. Many of these pathways can also be impinged upon by environmental risk factors associated with the disorder. The mouse model system provides a method to experimentally manipulate candidate genes for autism susceptibility, and to use environmental challenges to drive aberrant gene expression and cell pathology early in development. Mouse models for fragile X syndrome, Rett syndrome and other disorders associated with autistic-like behavior have elucidated neuropathology that might underlie the autism phenotype, including abnormalities in synaptic plasticity. Mouse models have also been used to investigate the effects of alterations in signaling pathways on neuronal migration, neurotransmission and brain anatomy, relevant to findings in autistic populations. Advances have included the evaluation of mouse models with behavioral assays designed to reflect disease symptoms, including impaired social interaction, communication deficits and repetitive behaviors, and the symptom onset during the neonatal period. Research focusing on the effect of gene-by-gene interactions or genetic susceptibility to detrimental environmental challenges may further understanding of the complex etiology for autism.},

abstract = {Profound impairment in social interaction is a core symptom of autism, a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. Deficits can include a lack of interest in social contact and low levels of approach and proximity to other children. In this study, a three-chambered choice task was used to evaluate sociability and social novelty preference in five lines of mice with mutations in genes implicated in autism spectrum disorders. Fmr1(tm1Cgr/Y)(Fmr1(-/y)) mice represent a model for fragile X, a mental retardation syndrome that is partially comorbid with autism. We tested Fmr1(-/y)mice on two genetic backgrounds, C57BL/6J and FVB/N-129/OlaHsd (FVB/129). Targeted disruption of Fmr1 resulted in low sociability on one measure, but only when the mutation was expressed on FVB/129. Autism has been associated with altered serotonin levels and polymorphisms in SLC6A4 (SERT), the serotonin transporter gene. Male mice with targeted disruption of Slc6a4 displayed significantly less sociability than wild-type controls. Mice with conditional overexpression of Igf-1 (insulin-like growth factor-1) offered a model for brain overgrowth associated with autism. Igf-1 transgenic mice engaged in levels of social approach similar to wild-type controls. Targeted disruption in other genes of interest, En2 (engrailed-2) and Dhcr7, was carried on genetic backgrounds that showed low levels of exploration in the choice task, precluding meaningful interpretations of social behavior scores. Overall, results show that loss of Fmr1 or Slc6a4 gene function can lead to deficits in sociability. Findings from the fragile X model suggest that the FVB/129 background confers enhanced susceptibility to consequences of Fmr1 mutation on social approach.},

Here we show that the maturation of these structures is an important determinant for the development of spatial selectivity in the ferret auditory cortex. Spatial response fields (SRFs) of high-frequency cortical neurons recorded at postnatal days (P) 33-39 were broader, and transmitted less information about stimulus direction, than in older ferrets. They also exhibited slightly broader frequency tuning than neurons recorded in adult animals. However, when infant neurons were stimulated through virtual ears of adults, SRFs sharpened significantly and the amount of transmitted information increased. This improvement was predicted by a model that generates SRF shape from the localization cue values and the neurons' binaural spectrotemporal response properties. The maturation of spatial response characteristics in auditory cortex therefore seems to be limited by peripheral rather than by central factors.},

In addition, neurons possess other, homeostatic means of compensating for changes in sensory input, but their role in cortical plasticity is unclear. We used two-photon calcium imaging to investigate whether homeostatic response regulation contributes to changes of eye-specific responsiveness after monocular deprivation (MD) in mouse visual cortex. Short MD durations decreased deprived-eye responses in neurons with binocular input. Longer MD periods strengthened open-eye responses, and surprisingly, also increased deprived-eye responses in neurons devoid of open-eye input. These bidirectional response adjustments effectively preserved the net visual drive for each neuron. Our finding that deprived-eye responses were either weaker or stronger after MD, depending on the amount of open-eye input a cell received, argues for both Hebbian and homeostatic mechanisms regulating neuronal responsiveness during experience-dependent plasticity. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Mice with a mutation targeted to the Fmr1 gene lack FMRP and thus are a valuable animal model for studying the behavioral and neural phenotype of this human disorder. Mice of two genetic backgrounds containing the Fmr1 mutation, C57BL/6J (C57-KO) and an F1 hybrid (C57BL/6J mutant x FVB/NJ; F1-KO) did not differ from control mice in behavior in the elevated plus maze or the open field. Both the C57-KO and F1-KO mice exhibited greater startle responses than normal mice to low intensity (80 dB) white noise bursts and decreased responses to high intensity (120 dB) white noise bursts. These behavioral alterations appear to be specific to the Fmr1 mutation since they are present on both genetic backgrounds. Furthermore, the mice lacking FMRP resemble individuals with fragile X syndrome in their increased sensitivity to low intensity auditory stimuli. These findings should prove useful in determining how the absence of FMRP alters the brain and behavior, and in testing potential treatments for fragile X syndrome. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Exposure to sound of sufficient duration and level causes permanent damage to the peripheral auditory system, which results in the reorganization of the cortical tonotopic map. The changes are such that neurons with pre-exposure tuning to frequencies in the hearing loss range now become tuned to frequencies near the near-normal lower boundary of the hearing loss range, which thus becomes over represented. However, cats exposed to a traumatizing noise and immediately thereafter placed for a few weeks in an enriched acoustic environment presented a much-restricted hearing loss compared with similarly exposed cats that were placed for the same time in a quiet environment. The enriched environment spectrally matched the expected hearing loss range and was approximately 40 dB above the level of the expected hearing loss. The hearing loss in the quiet environment-reared cats ranged from 6 to 32 kHz with the largest loss (on average, 40 dB) ranging from 24 to 32 kHz. In contrast, the hearing loss in the enriched-environment cats was restricted to 6-8 kHz at a level of, on average, 35 dB and with 16-32 kHz having normal thresholds. Despite the remaining hearing loss for the enriched-environment cats in the 6-8 kHz range, plastic tonotopic map changes in primary auditory cortex could no longer be demonstrated, suggesting that the enriched acoustic environment prevents this reorganization. This finding has implications for the treatment of hearing disorders, such as tinnitus, that have been linked to cortical tonotopic map reorganization.},

Lysosomal storage in neurons of the brain and the associated behavioral abnormalities characteristic of a murine model of MPS VII have not been shown to be corrected by either bone marrow transplantation or gene therapy. However, intravenous injections of recombinant beta-glucuronidase initiated at birth reduce the pathological evidence of disease in MPS VII mice. In this study we present evidence that enzyme replacement initiated at birth improved the behavioral performance and reduced hearing loss in MPS VII mice. Enzyme-treated MPS VII mice performed similarly to normal mice and significantly better than mock- treated MPS VII mice in every phase of the Morris Water Maze test. In addition, the auditory function of treated MPS VII mice was dramatically improved, and was indistinguishable from normal mice. These data indicate that some of the learning, memory, and hearing deficits can be prevented in MPS VII mice if enzyme replacement therapy is initiated early in life. These data also provide functional correlates to the biochemical and histopathological improvements observed after enzyme replacement therapy.},

abstract = {Differential aversive auditory conditioning in the awake Mongolian gerbil was performed during single- and multi-unit recording in field Al of the primary auditory cortex. Presentations of pure tone stimuli of a given frequency (reinforced conditioned stimulus; CS+) paired with electrocutaneous stimulation (unconditioned stimulus) were combined with several other non-reinforced tone stimuli (non-reinforced conditioned stimulus; CS-). Stimulus presentation during training and testing was optimized for constancy of the probability of occurrence of both the CS+ and the CS- stimulus. The paradigm led to a reorganization of both the spectral and temporal response characteristics of auditory cortical neurons with the following basic results. First, tone-evoked responses of Al neurons recorded after multiple acoustic stimulation under these conditions varied statistically around a mean value (stationarity). Conditioning produced a shift in mean values of evoked responses. The altered tone responses were also stationary (stability of the plastic effects). Second, the frequency-receptive fields (FRFs) of neurons were reorganized in a frequency-specific way such that the CS+ frequency became located in a local minimum of the FRF after training. This resulted from a training-induced increase in the responses to frequencies adjacent to the CS+ frequency in the FRF relative to the CS+ response. The effect can be interpreted as an enhancement of the 'spectral contrast' sensitivity of the unit in the CS+ neighbourhood. Third, apart from this frequency-specific plastic effect, responses to other frequencies also underwent changes during training. The non-frequency-specific changes were not generally predictable but the post-trial responses were stationary. Fourth, the analysis of the long-term behaviour of FRF reorganization revealed the stability of plastic effects under retention training and the gradual re-establishment of the pretrial FRF during extinction training. Fifth, not only the spectral characteristics but also the temporal structure of the tone-evoked responses could be affected by the training. In most cases the training-induced changes measured within the first tens of milliseconds of the response corresponded to the response changes obtained by integration over the total response period. There were some cases, however, in which the direction of the response change varied with time, indicating that excitatory and inhibitory influences on the temporal response pattern were differently affected by training.},

These findings are correlated with increased numbers of sites in the ICC that responded to the AAE frequency and show higher thresholds. There also were persistent effects in neurons with a best frequency higher than the AAE stimulus. These neurons showed decreased activity at low sound levels in the low frequency tail of the frequency response area. This was at, below and above the AAE stimulus frequency. Less often, increased activity at higher sound levels also was seen. Together, these findings suggest multifaceted interactions between activity-dependent plasticity, homeostasis, and development in the brainstem during the initial stages of hearing. A neonate exposed to an altered auditory environment may experience long-lasting change over the entire network of the auditory system. © 2011 IBRO.},

abstract = {Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by loss of the FMR1 gene product FMRP (fragile X mental retardation protein), a repressor of mRNA translation. According to the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) theory of FXS, excessive protein synthesis downstream of mGluR5 activation causes the synaptic pathophysiology that underlies multiple aspects of FXS. Here, we use an in vitro assay of protein synthesis in the hippocampus of male Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mice to explore the molecular mechanisms involved in this core biochemical phenotype under conditions where aberrant synaptic physiology has been observed. We find that elevated basal protein synthesis in Fmr1 KO mice is selectively reduced to wild-type levels by acute inhibition of mGluR5 or ERK1/2, but not by inhibition of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). The mGluR5-ERK1/2 pathway is not constitutively overactive in the Fmr1 KO, however, suggesting that mRNA translation is hypersensitive to basal ERK1/2 activation in the absence of FMRP. We find that hypersensitivity to ERK1/2 pathway activation also contributes to audiogenic seizure susceptibility in the Fmr1 KO. These results suggest that the ERK1/2 pathway, and other neurotransmitter systems that stimulate protein synthesis via ERK1/2, represent additional therapeutic targets for FXS.},

abstract = {Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of mental retardation and is caused by transcriptional inactivation of the X-linked fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. FXS is associated with increased density and abnormal morphology of dendritic spines, the postsynaptic sites of the majority of excitatory synapses. To better understand how lack of the FMR1 gene function affects spine development and plasticity, we examined spine formation and elimination of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the whisker barrel cortex of Fmr1 KO mice with a transcranial two-photon imaging technique. We found that the rates of spine formation and elimination over days to weeks were significantly higher in both young and adult KO mice compared with littermate controls. The heightened spine turnover in KO mice was due to the existence of a larger pool of "short-lived" new spines in KO mice than in controls. Furthermore, we found that the formation of new spines and the elimination of existing ones were less sensitive to modulation by sensory experience in KO mice. These results indicate that the loss of Fmr1 gene function leads to ongoing overproduction of transient spines in the primary somatosensory cortex. The insensitivity of spine formation and elimination to sensory alterations in Fmr1 KO mice suggest that the developing synaptic circuits may not be properly tuned by sensory stimuli in FXS.},

abstract = {Acoustic stimuli are processed throughout the auditory projection pathway, including the neocortex, by neurons that are aggregated into 'tonotopic' maps according to their specific frequency tunings. Research on animals has shown that tonotopic representations are not statically fixed in the adult organism but can reorganize after damage to the cochlea or after training the intact subject to discriminate between auditory stimuli. Here we used functional magnetic source imaging (single dipole model) to measure cortical representations in highly skilled musicians. Dipole moments for piano tones, but not for pure tones of similar fundamental frequency (matched in loudness), were found to be enlarged by about 25\% in musicians compared with control subjects who had never played an instrument. Enlargement was correlated with the age at which musicians began to practise and did not differ between musicians with absolute or relative pitch. These results, when interpreted with evidence for modified somatosensory representations of the fingering digits in skilled violinists, suggest that use-dependent functional reorganization extends across the sensory cortices to reflect the pattern of sensory input processed by the subject during development of musical skill.},

abstract = {It has become increasingly clear that even occasional exposure to loud sounds in occupational or recreational settings can cause irreversible damage to the hair cells of the cochlea and the auditory nerve fibers, even if the resulting partial loss of hearing sensitivity, usually accompanied by tinnitus, disappears within hours or days of the exposure. Such exposure may explain at least some cases of poor speech intelligibility in noise in the face of a normal or near-normal audiogram. Recent findings from our laboratory suggest that long-term changes to auditory brain function-potentially leading to problems with speech intelligibility-can be effected by persistent, passive exposure to more moderate levels of noise (in the 70 dB SPL range) in the apparent absence of damage to the auditory periphery (as reflected in normal distortion product otoacoustic emissions and auditory brainstem responses). Specifically, passive exposure of adult cats to moderate levels of band-pass-filtered noise, or to band-limited ensembles of dense, random tone pips, can lead to a profound decrease of neural activity in the auditory cortex roughly in the exposure frequency range, and to an increase of activity outside that range. This can progress to an apparent reorganization of the cortical tonotopic map, which is reminiscent of the reorganization resulting from hearing loss restricted to a part of the hearing frequency range, although again, no hearing loss was apparent after our moderate-level sound exposure. Here, we review this work focusing specifically on the potential hearing problems that may arise despite a normally functioning auditory periphery.},

abstract = {Degraded sensory experience during critical periods of development can have adverse effects on brain function. In the auditory system, conductive hearing loss associated with childhood ear infections can produce long-lasting deficits in auditory perceptual acuity, much like amblyopia in the visual system. Here we explore the neural mechanisms that may underlie "amblyaudio" by inducing reversible monaural deprivation (MD) in infant, juvenile, and adult rats. MD distorted tonotopic maps, weakened the deprived ear's representation, strengthened the open ear's representation, and disrupted binaural integration of interaural level differences (ILD). Bidirectional plasticity effects were strictly governed by critical periods, were more strongly expressed in primary auditory cortex than inferior colliculus, and directly impacted neural coding accuracy. These findings highlight a remarkable degree of competitive plasticity between aural representations and suggest that the enduring perceptual sequelae of childhood hearing loss might be traced to maladaptive plasticity during critical periods of auditory cortex development.},

abstract = {Inflammation has been implicated in the progression of neurological disease, yet precisely how inflammation affects neuronal function remains unclear. Tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF$\alpha$) is a proinflammatory cytokine that regulates synapse function by controlling neurotransmitter receptor trafficking and homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Here we characterize the mechanisms through which TNF$\alpha$ regulates inhibitory synapse function in mature rat and mouse hippocampal neurons. Acute application of TNF$\alpha$ induces a rapid and persistent decrease of inhibitory synaptic strength and downregulation of cell-surface levels of GABA(A)Rs containing $\alpha$1, $\alpha$2, $\beta$2/3, and $\gamma$2 subunits. We show that trafficking of GABA(A)Rs in response to TNF$\alpha$ is mediated by neuronally expressed TNF receptor 1 and requires activation of p38 MAPK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), and dynamin GTPase. Furthermore, TNF$\alpha$ enhances the association of PP1 with GABA(A)R $\beta$3 subunits and dephosphorylates a site on $\beta$3 known to regulate phospho-dependent interactions with the endocytic machinery. Conversely, we find that calcineurin and PP2A are not essential components of the signaling pathway and that clustering of the scaffolding protein gephyrin is only reduced after the initial receptor endocytosis. Together, these findings demonstrate a distinct mechanism of regulated GABA(A)R endocytosis that may contribute to the disruption of circuit homeostasis under neuroinflammatory conditions.},

Such global scaling preserves the relative strengths of synapses and thus keeps 'Hebbian-like' memory traces (long-term potentiations, LTP, or depressions, LTD). However, new experimental findings demonstrate that HSP can operate locally, controlling each synapse individually. Seemingly, this finding implies that HSP can abolish any modification of synaptic strength (erase LTP/LTD). We propose that dendrites offer an inherent solution to this 'paradox' and that in fact local HSP might confer upon the neuron several surprising benefits, which are demonstrated using computer simulations.},

abstract = {Ocular dominance (OD) plasticity in the visual cortex is a classic model system for understanding developmental plasticity, but the visual cortex also shows plasticity in adulthood. Whether the plasticity mechanisms are similar or different at the two ages is not clear. Several plasticity mechanisms operate during development, including homeostatic plasticity, which acts to maintain the total excitatory drive to a neuron. In agreement with this idea, we found that an often-studied substrain of C57BL/6 mice, C57BL/6JOlaHsd (6JOla), lacks both the homeostatic component of OD plasticity as assessed by intrinsic signal imaging and synaptic scaling of mEPSC amplitudes after a short period of dark exposure during the critical period, whereas another substrain, C57BL/6J (6J), exhibits both plasticity processes. However, in adult mice, OD plasticity was identical in the 6JOla and 6J substrains, suggesting that adult plasticity occurs by a different mechanism. Consistent with this interpretation, adult OD plasticity was normal in TNF$\alpha$ knockout mice, which are known to lack juvenile synaptic scaling and the homeostatic component of OD plasticity, but was absent in adult $\alpha$-calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II;T286A ($\alpha$CaMKII(T286A)) mice, which have a point mutation that prevents autophosphorylation of $\alpha$CaMKII. We conclude that increased responsiveness to open-eye stimulation after monocular deprivation during the critical period is a homeostatic process that depends mechanistically on synaptic scaling during the critical period, whereas in adult mice it is mediated by a different mechanism that requires $\alpha$CaMKII autophosphorylation. Thus, our study reveals a transition between homeostatic and long-term potentiation-like plasticity mechanisms with increasing age.},

This symposium will consider evidence that deafferentation of tonotopically organized central auditory structures leads to increased neuron spontaneous firing rates and neural synchrony in the hearing loss region. This region covers the frequency spectrum of tinnitus sounds, which are optimally suppressed following exposure to band-limited noise covering the same frequencies. Cross-modal compensations in subcortical structures may contribute to tinnitus and its modulation by jaw-clenching and eye movements. Yet many older individuals with impaired hearing do not have tinnitus, possibly because age-related changes in inhibitory circuits are better preserved. A brain network involving limbic and other nonauditory regions is active in tinnitus and may be driven when spectrotemporal information conveyed by the damaged ear does not match that predicted by central auditory processing.},

In electrophysiological experiments, we show that long-term potentiation at thalamic input synapses to the LA is impaired by bath application of a specific mGluR5 antagonist, 2-methyl-6-(phenyle-thynyl)-pyridine (MPEP), in vitro. Finally, we show that intra-amygdala administration of MPEP dose-dependently impairs the acquisition, but not expression or consolidation, of auditory and contextual fear conditioning. Collectively, the results of this study indicate that mGluR5 in the LA plays a crucial role in fear conditioning and in plasticity at synapses involved in fear conditioning.},

Clinical, behavioral, and electrophysiological studies consistently show auditory hypersensitivity in humans with FXS. Consistent with observations in humans, the Fmr1 KO mouse model of FXS also shows evidence of altered auditory processing and communication deficiencies. A well-known and commonly used phenotype in pre-clinical studies of FXS is audiogenic seizures. In addition, increased acoustic startle response is seen in the Fmr1 KO mice. In vivo electrophysiological recordings indicate hyper-excitable responses, broader frequency tuning, and abnormal spectrotemporal processing in primary auditory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice. Thus, auditory hyper-excitability is a robust, reliable, and translatable biomarker in Fmr1 KO mice. Abnormal auditory evoked responses have been used as outcome measures to test therapeutics in FXS patients. Given that similarly abnormal responses are present in Fmr1 KO mice suggests that cellular mechanisms can be addressed. Sensory cortical deficits are relatively more tractable from a mechanistic perspective than more complex social behaviors that are typically studied in autism and FXS. The focus of this review is to bring together clinical, functional, and structural studies in humans with electrophysiological and behavioral studies in mice to make the case that auditory hypersensitivity provides a unique opportunity to integrate molecular, cellular, circuit level studies with behavioral outcomes in the search for therapeutics for FXS and other autism spectrum disorders.},

abstract = {Sensory experience during development can modify the CNS and alter adult perceptual skills. While this principle draws support from deprivation or chronic stimulus exposure studies, the effect of training is addressed only in adults. Here, we asked whether a brief period of training during development can exert a unique impact on adult perceptual skills. Juvenile gerbils were trained to detect amplitude modulation (AM), a stimulus feature elemental to animal communication sounds. When the performance of these juvenile-trained animals was subsequently assessed in adulthood, it was superior to a control group that received an identical regimen of training as adults. The juvenile-trained animals displayed significantly better AM detection thresholds. This was not observed in an adult group that received only exposure to AM stimuli as juveniles. To determine whether enhanced adult performance was due solely to learning the conditioned avoidance procedure, juveniles were trained on frequency modulation (FM) detection, and subsequently assessed on AM detection as adults. These animals displayed significantly poorer AM detection thresholds than all other groups. Thus, training on a specific auditory task (AM detection) during development provided a benefit to performance on that task in adulthood, whereas an identical training regimen in adulthood did not bring about this enhancement. In contrast, there was a cost, in adulthood, following developmental training on a different task (FM detection). Together, the results demonstrate a period of heightened sensitivity in the developing CNS such that behavioral training in juveniles has a unique impact on adult behavioral capabilities.},

Animal studies show that the occurrence of tinnitus is correlated to increased spontaneous firing rates of central auditory neurons, but mechanisms that give rise to such hyperactivity have not been identified yet. Here we present a computational model that reproduces tinnitus-related hyperactivity and predicts tinnitus pitch from the audiograms of tinnitus patients with noise-induced hearing loss and tone-like tinnitus. Our key assumption is that the mean firing rates of central auditory neurons are controlled by homeostatic plasticity. Decreased auditory nerve activity after hearing loss is counteracted through an increase of the neuronal response gain, which restores the mean rate but can also lead to hyperactivity. Hyperactivity patterns calculated from patients' audiograms exhibit distinct peaks at frequencies close to the perceived tinnitus pitch, corroborating hyperactivity through homeostatic plasticity as a mechanism for the development of tinnitus after hearing loss. The model suggests that such hyperactivity, and thus also tinnitus caused by cochlear damage, could be alleviated through additional stimulation.},

Animal studies indicate that hearing loss through cochlear damage can lead to behavioral signs of tinnitus that are correlated with pathologically increased spontaneous firing rates, or hyperactivity, of neurons in the auditory pathway. Mechanisms that lead to the development of this hyperactivity, however, have remained unclear. We address this question by using a computational model of auditory nerve fibers and downstream auditory neurons. The key idea is that mean firing rates of these neurons are stabilized through a homeostatic plasticity mechanism. This homeostatic compensation can give rise to hyperactivity in the model neurons if the healthy ratio between mean and spontaneous firing rate of the auditory nerve is decreased, for example through a loss of outer hair cells or damage to hair cell stereocilia. Homeostasis can also amplify non-auditory inputs, which then contribute to hyperactivity. Our computational model predicts how appropriate additional acoustic stimulation can reverse the development of such hyperactivity, which could provide a new basis for treatment strategies.},

abstract = {This study focused on the cytoarchitectonic and morphological differences in GABA-releasing interneurons between adult Fmr1 knock-out (FMR1KO) and wild-type (WT) mice in the somatosensory cortex. Our results showed a robust reorganization of neocortical, but not hippocampal inhibitory circuits in the FMR1KO mouse. The reorganization is characterized by a significant reduction (20\%, p < 0.001) in the densities of parvalbumin (PV)-positive, but not calbindin (CB) and calretinin (CR)-positive interneurons. A significant enlargement of soma size and an altered lamina distribution of PV but not CR and CB cells was also observed. Additionally, there was a modest but significant increase in TrkB-immunoreactivity in PV-positive cells in the FMR1KO mouse. These results provide the first report showing significant alterations of GABA-releasing interneurons in the mouse model of fragile X syndrome. Uncovering the changes in specific GABAergic inhibitory circuits could help understand mechanisms underlying the behavior deficits of fragile X syndrome and autism. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {Homeostatic synaptic plasticity adjusts the strength of synapses during global changes in neural activity, thereby stabilizing the overall activity of neural networks. Suppression of synaptic activity increases synaptic strength by inducing synthesis of retinoic acid (RA), which activates postsynaptic synthesis of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) in dendrites and promotes synaptic insertion of newly synthesized AMPARs. Here, we show that fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein that regulates dendritic protein synthesis, is essential for increases in synaptic strength induced by RA or by blockade of neural activity in the mouse hippocampus. Although activity-dependent RA synthesis is maintained in Fmr1 knock-out neurons, RA-dependent dendritic translation of GluR1-type AMPA receptors is impaired. Intriguingly, FMRP is only required for the form of homeostatic plasticity that is dependent on both RA signaling and local protein synthesis. Postsynaptic expression of wild-type or mutant FMRP(I304N) in knock-out neurons reduced the total, surface, and synaptic levels of AMPARs, implying a role for FMRP in regulating AMPAR abundance. Expression of FMRP lacking the RGG box RNA-binding domain had no effect on AMPAR levels. Importantly, postsynaptic expression of wild-type FMRP, but not FMRP(I304N) or FMRP$\Delta$RGG, restored synaptic scaling when expressed in knock-out neurons. Together, these findings identify an unanticipated role for FMRP in regulating homeostatic synaptic plasticity downstream of RA. Our results raise the possibility that at least some of the symptoms of fragile X syndrome reflect impaired homeostatic plasticity and impaired RA signaling.},

abstract = {Glial tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF$\alpha$) is essential for scaling up of synapses during prolonged activity blockade, but whether TNF$\alpha$ is an instructive or permissive signal is not known. Here we show in rat cortical neurons that the effects of TNF$\alpha$ and activity blockade are not additive; whereas TNF$\alpha$ increased AMPA quantal amplitude at control synapses, TNF$\alpha$ reduced quantal amplitude at prescaled synapses, demonstrating state-dependent effects of TNF$\alpha$ signaling on the scaling process. Whereas synaptic scaling during prolonged activity blockade [24 h tetrodotoxin (TTX)] was prevented by blocking TNF$\alpha$ signaling, early scaling (6 h TTX) was not, unless TNF$\alpha$ signaling was first blocked for 24 h. Moreover, when synapses were prescaled, prolonged (24 h) but not brief (6 h) blockade of TNF$\alpha$ signaling reversed scaling. Finally, prolonged block of TNF$\alpha$ signaling modified the synaptic localization of several scaffold proteins, suggesting that maintenance of postsynaptic density composition is TNF$\alpha$ dependent. Together, these data suggest that TNF$\alpha$ is not an instructive signal for scaling but rather is critical for maintaining synapses in a plastic state in which synaptic scaling can be expressed.},

abstract = {The proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) causes a rapid exocytosis of AMPA receptors in hippocampal pyramidal cells and is constitutively required for the maintenance of normal surface expression of AMPA receptors. Here we demonstrate that TNFalpha acts on neuronal TNFR1 receptors to preferentially exocytose glutamate receptor 2-lacking AMPA receptors through a phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase-dependent process. This increases excitatory synaptic strength while changing the molecular stoichiometry of synaptic AMPA receptors. Conversely, TNFalpha causes an endocytosis of GABA(A) receptors, resulting in fewer surface GABA(A) receptors and a decrease in inhibitory synaptic strength. These results suggest that TNFalpha can regulate neuronal circuit homeostasis in a manner that may exacerbate excitotoxic damage resulting from neuronal insults.},

abstract = {Two general forms of synaptic plasticity that operate on different timescales are thought to contribute to the activity-dependent refinement of neural circuitry during development: (1) long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), which involve rapid adjustments in the strengths of individual synapses in response to specific patterns of correlated synaptic activity, and (2) homeostatic synaptic scaling, which entails uniform adjustments in the strength of all synapses on a cell in response to prolonged changes in the cell's electrical activity. Without homeostatic synaptic scaling, neural networks can become unstable and perform suboptimally. Although much is known about the mechanisms underlying LTP and LTD, little is known about the mechanisms responsible for synaptic scaling except that such scaling is due, at least in part, to alterations in receptor content at synapses. Here we show that synaptic scaling in response to prolonged blockade of activity is mediated by the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour-necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Using mixtures of wild-type and TNF-alpha-deficient neurons and glia, we also show that glia are the source of the TNF-alpha that is required for this form of synaptic scaling. We suggest that by modulating TNF-alpha levels, glia actively participate in the homeostatic activity-dependent regulation of synaptic connectivity.},

abstract = {Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an RNA-binding protein that regulates synaptic plasticity by repressing translation of specific mRNAs. We found that FMRP binds mRNA encoding the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv3.1b in brainstem synaptosomes. To explore the regulation of Kv3.1b by FMRP, we investigated Kv3.1b immunoreactivity and potassium currents in the auditory brainstem sound localization circuit of male mice. The unique features of this circuit allowed us to control neuronal activity in vivo by exposing animals to high-frequency, amplitude-modulated stimuli, which elicit predictable and stereotyped patterns of input to the anterior ventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) and medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB). In wild-type (WT) animals, Kv3.1b is expressed along a tonotopic gradient in the MNTB, with highest levels in neurons at the medial, high-frequency end. At baseline, Fmr1(-/-) mice, which lack FMRP, displayed dramatically flattened tonotopicity in Kv3.1b immunoreactivity and K(+) currents relative to WT controls. Moreover, after 30 min of acoustic stimulation, levels of Kv3.1b immunoreactivity were significantly elevated in both the MNTB and AVCN of WT, but not Fmr1(-/-), mice. These results suggest that FMRP is necessary for maintenance of the gradient in Kv3.1b protein levels across the tonotopic axis of the MNTB, and are consistent with a role for FMRP as a repressor of protein translation. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that Kv3.1b tonotopicity may be required for accurate encoding of stimulus features such as modulation rate, and that disruption of this gradient, as occurs in Fmr1(-/-) animals, degrades processing of this information.},

abstract = {Functional receptive fields of neurons in sensory cortices undergo progressive refinement during development. Such refinement may be attributed to the pruning of non-optimal excitatory inputs, reshaping of the excitatory tuning profile through modifying the strengths of individual inputs, or strengthening of cortical inhibition. These models have not been directly tested because of the technical difficulties in assaying the spatiotemporal patterns of functional synaptic inputs during development. Here we apply in vivo whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings to the recipient layer 4 neurons in the rat primary auditory cortex (A1) to determine the developmental changes in the frequency-intensity tonal receptive fields (TRFs) of their excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Surprisingly, we observe co-tuned excitation and inhibition immediately after the onset of hearing, suggesting that a tripartite thalamocortical circuit with relatively strong feedforward inhibition is formed independently of auditory experience. The frequency ranges of tone-driven excitatory and inhibitory inputs first expand within a few days of the onset of hearing and then persist into adulthood. The latter phase is accompanied by a sharpening of the excitatory but not inhibitory frequency tuning profile, which results in relatively broader inhibitory tuning in adult A1 neurons. Thus the development of cortical synaptic TRFs after the onset of hearing is marked by a slight breakdown of previously formed excitation-inhibition balance. Our results suggest that functional refinement of cortical TRFs does not require a selective pruning of inputs, but may depend more on a fine adjustment of excitatory input strengths.},

abstract = {Traditionally the auditory system was considered a hard-wired sensory system; this view has been challenged in recent years in light of the plasticity of other sensory systems, particularly the visual and somatosensory systems. Practical experience in clinical audiology together with the use of prosthetic devices, such as cochlear implants, contributed significantly to the present view on the plasticity of the central auditory system, which was originally based on data obtained in animal experiments. The loss of auditory receptors, the hair cells, results in profound changes in the structure and function of the central auditory system, typically demonstrated by a reorganization of the projection maps in the auditory cortex. These plastic changes occur not only as a consequence of mechanical lesions of the cochlea or biochemical lesions of the hair cells by ototoxic drugs, but also as a consequence of the loss of hair cells in connection with aging or noise exposure. In light of the aging world population and the increasing amount of noise in the modern world, understanding the plasticity of the central auditory system has its practical consequences and urgency. In most of these situations, a common denominator of central plastic changes is a deterioration of inhibition in the subcortical auditory nuclei and the auditory cortex. In addition to the processes that are elicited by decreased or lost receptor function, the function of nerve cells in the adult central auditory system may dynamically change in the process of learning. A better understanding of the plastic changes in the central auditory system after sensory deafferentation, sensory stimulation, and learning may contribute significantly to improvement in the rehabilitation of damaged or lost auditory function and consequently to improved speech processing and production.},

abstract = {Cortical reorganizations during acquisition of motor skills and experience-dependent recovery after deafferentation consist of several distinct phases, in which expansion of receptive fields is followed by the shrinkage and use-dependent refinement. In perceptual learning, however, such non-monotonic, stage-dependent plasticity remains elusive in the sensory cortex. In the present study, microelectrode mapping characterized plasticity in the rat auditory cortex, including primary, anterior, and ventral/suprarhinal auditory fields (A1, AAF, and VAF/SRAF), at the early and late stages of appetitive operant conditioning. We first demonstrate that most plasticity at the early stage was tentative, and that long-lasting plasticity after extended training was able to be categorized into either early- or late-stage-dominant plasticity. Second, training-induced plasticity occurred both locally and globally with a specific temporal order. Conditioned-stimulus (CS) frequency used in the task tended to be locally over-represented in AAF at the early stage and in VAF/SRAF at the late stage. The behavioral relevance of neural responses suggests that the local plasticity also occurred in A1 at the early stage. In parallel, the tone-responsive area globally shrank at the late stage independently of CS frequency, and this shrinkage was also correlated with the behavioral improvements. Thus, the stage-dependent plasticity may commonly underlie cortical reorganization in the perceptual learning, yet the interactions of local and global plasticity have led to more complicated reorganization than previously thought. Field-specific plasticity has important implications for how each field subserves in the learning; for example, consistent with recent notions, A1 should construct filters to better identify auditory objects at the early stage, while VAF/SRAF contribute to hierarchical computation and storage at the late stage. © 2011 IBRO.},

abstract = {Many studies in human and animal models have shown that neural plasticity compensates for the loss of motor function after stroke. However, neural plasticity concerning compensatory movement, activated ipsilateral motor projections and competitive interaction after stroke contributes to maladaptive plasticity, which negatively affects motor recovery. Compensatory movement on the less-affected side helps to perform self-sustaining activity but also creates an inappropriate movement pattern and ultimately limits the normal motor pattern. The activated ipsilateral motor projections after stroke are unable to sufficiently support the disruption of the corticospinal motor projections and induce the abnormal movement linked to poor motor ability. The competitive interaction between both hemispheres induces abnormal interhemispheric inhibition that weakens motor function in stroke patients. Moreover, widespread disinhibition increases the risk of competitive interaction between the hand and the proximal arm, which results in an incomplete motor recovery. To minimize this maladaptive plasticity, rehabilitation programs should be selected according to the motor impairment of stroke patients. Noninvasive brain stimulation might also be useful for correcting maladaptive plasticity after stroke. Here, we review the underlying mechanisms of maladaptive plasticity after stroke and propose rehabilitation approaches for appropriate cortical reorganization.},

Currently, no studies have assessed the effect of mGluR1 modulation on Fmr1 KO behavior, and there has not been an extensive behavioral analysis of mGluR5 manipulation in Fmr1 KO mice.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: The goals for this study were to determine if pharmacologic blockade of mGluR1 may affect Fmr1 KO behavior as well as to expand on the current literature regarding pharmacologic blockade of mGluR5 on Fmr1 KO behavior.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Reduction of mGluR1 or mGluR5 activity was evaluated on a variety of behavioral assays in wild-type (WT) and Fmr1 KO mice through the use of antagonists: JNJ16259685 (JNJ, mGluR1 antagonist) and MPEP (mGluR5 antagonist).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: JNJ and MPEP decreased marble burying in both WT and Fmr1 KO mice without reductions in activity.

In the hippocampus the transient increase in the probability of inhibitory transmitter release associated with posttetanic potentiation was absent in the GAD65-/- mice. These results indicate that during and immediately after sustained stimulation the increase in the probability of transmitter release is not maintained in GAD65-/- mice.

abstract = {Fragile X syndrome is the leading inherited form of mental retardation, and second only to Down's syndrome as a cause of mental retardation attributable to an identifiable genetic abnormality. Fragile X syndrome is caused by a defect in the fragile X mental retardation 1 gene (FMR1), located near the end of the long arm of the X chromosome. FMR1 normally synthesises the fragile X protein (FMRP), but mutations in FMR1 lead to a lack of FMRP synthesis, resulting in fragile X syndrome. While the specific function of FMRP is not yet fully understood, the protein is known to be important for normal brain development. The physical, cognitive and behavioural features of individuals with fragile X syndrome depend on gender (females have two X chromosomes, one active and one inactive) and the molecular status of the mutation (premutation, full mutation or mosaic). Features of the behavioural profile of individuals with fragile X syndrome include hypersensitivity to stimuli, overarousability, inattention, hyperactivity and (mostly in men) explosive and aggressive behaviour to others or self. Social anxiety, other anxiety disorders, depression, impulse control disorder and mood disorders are the most common psychiatric disorders diagnosed in individuals with fragile X syndrome, although no formal studies have been undertaken. There have been very few psychopharmacological studies of the treatment of behaviours associated with fragile X syndrome. These limited studies and surveys of psychotropic drugs used in individuals with fragile X syndrome suggest that stimulants are helpful for hyperactivity, that alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists help to control overarousability, impulsivity and aggressiveness, and that SSRIs can control anxiety, impulsivity and irritability, alleviate depressive symptoms and decrease aggressive and self-injurious behaviour. Typical and atypical antipsychotics in combination with other psychotropics have been used for control of psychotic disorders and severe aggressive behaviours. Mood stabilisers have been found to be useful when mood dysregulation or mood disorders are present with or without aggressive behaviour. Folic acid and L-acetylcarnitine (levacecarnine) have not been found to improve deficits or behaviours. As there is no specific psychotropic drug for any of the deficits or behaviours associated with fragile X syndrome, clinicians are advised to diagnose any psychiatric syndromes or disorders present and treat them with the appropriate psychotropic drug. If no psychiatric disorder can be diagnosed and the patient's challenging behaviours cannot be controlled with environmental manipulation or behaviour modification techniques, the most benign psychotropic drug should be used. Antipsychotics should be reserved for psychotic disorders, for impulse control disorders (used in combination with other psychotropics), or when challenging behaviours constitute an emergency. In the future, new medications targeting molecules implicated in the modulation of anxiety, fear and fear responding will be useful for treating the social anxiety and overarousability exhibited by individuals with fragile X syndrome.},

abstract = {Information is stored in neural circuits through long-lasting changes in synaptic strengths. Most studies of information storage have focused on mechanisms such as long-term potentiation and depression (LTP and LTD), in which synaptic strengths change in a synapse-specific manner. In contrast, little attention has been paid to mechanisms that regulate the total synaptic strength of a neuron. Here we describe a new form of synaptic plasticity that increases or decreases the strength of all of a neuron's synaptic inputs as a function of activity. Chronic blockade of cortical culture activity increased the amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) without changing their kinetics. Conversely, blocking GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-mediated inhibition initially raised firing rates, but over a 48-hour period mESPC amplitudes decreased and firing rates returned to close to control values. These changes were at least partly due to postsynaptic alterations in the response to glutamate, and apparently affected each synapse in proportion to its initial strength. Such 'synaptic scaling' may help to ensure that firing rates do not become saturated during developmental changes in the number and strength of synaptic inputs, as well as stabilizing synaptic strengths during Hebbian modification and facilitating competition between synapses.},

Recent work has demonstrated that this destabilizing influence is counteracted by a number of homeostatic plasticity mechanisms that stabilize neuronal activity. Such mechanisms include global changes in synaptic strengths, changes in neuronal excitability, and the regulation of synapse number. These recent studies suggest that Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity often target the same molecular substrates, and have opposing effects on synaptic or neuronal properties. These advances significantly broaden our framework for understanding the effects of activity on synaptic function and neuronal excitability.},

abstract = {Activity has an important role in refining synaptic connectivity during development, in part through 'Hebbian' mechanisms such as long-term potentiation and long-term depression. However, Hebbian plasticity is probably insufficient to explain activity-dependent development because it tends to destabilize the activity of neural circuits. How can complex circuits maintain stable activity states in the face of such destabilizing forces? An idea that is emerging from recent work is that average neuronal activity levels are maintained by a set of homeostatic plasticity mechanisms that dynamically adjust synaptic strengths in the correct direction to promote stability. Here we discuss evidence from a number of systems that homeostatic synaptic plasticity is crucial for processes ranging from memory storage to activity-dependent development.},

Most studies of long- term changes in synaptic strength have concentrated on Hebbian mechanisms, where these changes occur in a synapse-specific manner. While Hebbian mechanisms are important for modifying neuronal circuitry selectively, they might not be sufficient because they tend to destabilize the activity of neuronal networks. Recently, several forms of homeostatic plasticity that stabilize the properties of neural circuits have been identified. These include mechanisms that regulate neuronal excitability, stabilize total synaptic strength, and influence the rate and extent of synapse formation. These forms of homeostatic plasticity are likely to go 'hand-in-glove' with Hebbian mechanisms to allow experience to modify the properties of neuronal networks selectively.},

abstract = {We explore a synaptic plasticity model that incorporates recent findings that potentiation and depression can be induced by precisely timed pairs of synaptic events and postsynaptic spikes. In addition we include the observation that strong synapses undergo relatively less potentiation than weak synapses, whereas depression is independent of synaptic strength. After random stimulation, the synaptic weights reach an equilibrium distribution which is stable, unimodal, and has positive skew. This weight distribution compares favorably to the distributions of quantal amplitudes and of receptor number observed experimentally in central neurons and contrasts to the distribution found in plasticity models without size-dependent potentiation. Also in contrast to those models, which show strong competition between the synapses, stable plasticity is achieved with little competition. Instead, competition can be introduced by including a separate mechanism that scales synaptic strengths multiplicatively as a function of postsynaptic activity. In this model, synaptic weights change in proportion to how correlated they are with other inputs onto the same postsynaptic neuron. These results indicate that stable correlation-based plasticity can be achieved without introducing competition, suggesting that plasticity and competition need not coexist in all circuits or at all developmental stages.},

abstract = {Tinnitus is a phantom auditory sensation experienced by up to 14\% of the United States population with a smaller percentage experiencing decreased quality of life. A compelling hypothesis is that tinnitus results from a maladaptive plastic net down-regulation of inhibitory amino acid neurotransmission in the central auditory pathway. This loss of inhibition may be a compensatory response to loss of afferent input such as that caused by acoustic insult and/or age-related hearing loss, the most common causes of tinnitus in people. Compensatory plastic changes may result in pathologic neural activity that underpins tinnitus. The neural correlates include increased spontaneous spiking, increased bursting and decreased variance of inter-spike intervals. This review will examine evidence for chronic plastic neuropathic changes in the central auditory system of animals with psychophysically-defined tinnitus. Neurochemical studies will focus on plastic tinnitus-related changes of inhibitory glycinergic neurotransmission in the adult dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN). Electrophysiological studies will focus on functional changes in the DCN and inferior colliculus (IC). Tinnitus was associated with increased spontaneous activity and altered response properties of fusiform cells, the major output neurons of DCN. Coincident with these physiologic alterations were changes in glycine receptor (GlyR) subunit composition, its anchoring/trafficking protein, gephyrin and the number and affinity of membrane GlyRs revealed by receptor binding. In the IC, the primary afferent target of DCN fusiform cells, multi-dimensional alterations in unit-spontaneous activity (rate, burst rate, bursting pattern) were found in animals with behavioral evidence of chronic tinnitus more than 9 months following the acoustic/cochlear insult. In contrast, immediately following an intense sound exposure, acute alterations in IC spontaneous activity resembled chronic tinnitus-related changes but were not identical. This suggests that long-term neuroplastic changes responsible for chronic tinnitus are likely to be responsible for its persistence. A clear understanding of tinnitus-related plasticity in the central auditory system and its associated neurochemistry may help define unique targets for therapeutic drug development. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

LTP was induced in layer II/III, layer V or layer VI with theta burst stimulation (TBS), but was not observed in layer IV. In the presence of a NMDA antagonist, D-AP5, in the bath solution, potentiation was blocked in layer II/III, some depression was seen in layer V, and potentiation still remained in layer VI. After addition of a specific mGluR1 antagonist, LY367385, to the bath solution, LTP was reduced in layer II/III and layer V, and was blocked in layer VI. After a specific mGluR5 antagonist, MPEP was applied in the bath solution, LTP was enhanced in layer VI, and blocked in layer V. We conclude that: (1) LTP in layer VI is different from other layers, depending on mGluR1, but not NMDA receptors. (2) In layer II/III, LTP is NMDA-dependent and is not blocked by group I mGluR antagonists. (3) LTP in layer V is both NMDA receptor and mGluR5 receptor-dependent.

abstract = {Neurons in the primary auditory cortex are tuned to the intensity and specific frequencies of sounds, but the synaptic mechanisms underlying this tuning remain uncertain. Inhibition seems to have a functional role in the formation of cortical receptive fields, because stimuli often suppress similar or neighbouring responses, and pharmacological blockade of inhibition broadens tuning curves. Here we use whole-cell recordings in vivo to disentangle the roles of excitatory and inhibitory activity in the tone-evoked responses of single neurons in the auditory cortex. The excitatory and inhibitory receptive fields cover almost exactly the same areas, in contrast to the predictions of classical lateral inhibition models. Thus, although inhibition is typically as strong as excitation, it is not necessary to establish tuning, even in the receptive field surround. However, inhibition and excitation occurred in a precise and stereotyped temporal sequence: an initial barrage of excitatory input was rapidly quenched by inhibition, truncating the spiking response within a few (1-4) milliseconds. Balanced inhibition might thus serve to increase the temporal precision and thereby reduce the randomness of cortical operation, rather than to increase noise as has been proposed previously.},

Here we have used whole-cell recordings in vivo to assess the role of synaptic inhibition in forward suppression in auditory cortex. We measured the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances elicited by pairs of brief sounds presented at intervals from tens to hundreds of milliseconds. We find that inhibitory conductances rarely last longer than 50-100 ms, whereas spike responses and synaptic inputs remain suppressed for hundreds of milliseconds. We conclude that postsynaptic inhibition contributes to forward suppression for only the first 50-100 ms after a stimulus and that intracortical contributions to long-lasting suppression must involve other mechanisms, such as synaptic depression.},

abstract = {Fragile X syndrome is a common heritable form of mental retardation in humans. Recent neuroanatomical studies indicate an apparent immature appearance of neurons in fragile X syndrome patients and fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP)-knockout mice, an animal model of this condition. In this work, we investigated possible alterations in synaptic plasticity in the neocortex of FMRP-knockout mice. Extracellular field potentials were recorded from the deep-layer visual neocortex. Long-term potentiation (LTP) was severely attenuated in brain slices from knockout mice relative to that observed in slices from wild-type mice. Considering that neocortical LTP can involve both NMDA receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms, we attempted to distinguish the nature of LTP attenuated in the knockout condition. In slices from wild-type mice, LTP was partially attenuated by the NMDA receptor antagonist 3-[(+/-)-2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl]-propyl-1-phosphate (CPP); however, the general metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) antagonist alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (MCPG) strongly attenuated LTP, resulting in a response indistinguishable from that observed in slices from knockout mice. The selective mGluR5 antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP) attenuated LTP to a similar degree as did MCPG in wild-type slices, but MPEP did not alter the reduced potentiation in knockout slices. Our results suggest that LTP in layer V visual neocortex depends primarily on mGluR5 activation. Our data also indicate that mGluR5-mediated synaptic plasticity is absent in the neocortex of FMRP-knockout mice. Such an alteration may contribute to the cognitive and learning deficits exhibited in these mice as well as in fragile X syndrome.},

Here, in vivo whole-cell recordings from neurons in the rat primary auditory cortex revealed that the frequency tuning curve of inhibitory input was broader than that of excitatory input. This results in relatively stronger inhibition in frequency domains flanking the preferred frequencies of the cell and a significant sharpening of the frequency tuning of membrane responses. The less selective inhibition can be attributed to a broader bandwidth and lower threshold of spike tonal receptive field of fast-spike inhibitory neurons than nearby excitatory neurons, although both types of neurons receive similar ranges of excitatory input and are organized into the same tonotopic map. Thus, the balance between excitation and inhibition is only approximate, and intracortical inhibition with high sensitivity and low selectivity can laterally sharpen the frequency tuning of neurons, ensuring their highly selective representation. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

A Fragile X mouse model, fmr1tm1Cgr, with a disruption in the X-linked Fmr1 gene, has three substantial deficits observed in several strains: (1) sensitivity to audiogenic seizures (AGS), (2) tendency to spend significantly more time in the center of an open field, and (3) enlarged testes. Alterations in metabotropic glutamate receptor group I signaling were previously identified in the fmr1tm1Cgr mouse. In this study, we examined the effect of MPEP, an antagonist of the group I metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR5, on audiogenic seizures and open field activity of fmr1 tm1Cgr mice. Genetic analysis revealed synergistic reactions between fmr1tm1Cgr and inbred AGS alleles. In addition, AGS sensitivity due to the fmr1tm1Cgr allele was restricted during development. Examination of phenotypes combining mGluR5 inhibition and Fmr1 mutation indicated that absence of FMRP may affect mGluR5 signaling through indirect as well as direct pathways. All strains of fmr1tm1Cgr mice tested (FVB/NJ, C57BL/6J, and an F1 hybrid of the two) had a more excitable AGS pathway than wild-type, and consequently required more MPEP to achieve seizure suppression. At high doses of mGluR5 antagonists, a Fragile X specific tolerance (loss of drug activity) was observed. The tolerance effect could be overcome by a further increase in drug dose. In open field tests, MPEP reduced fmr1 tm1Cgr center field behavior to one indistinguishable from wild-type. Therefore, mGluR5 antagonists were able to rescue two of the major phenotypes of the FX mouse.

Recent studies have implicated certain types of synaptic plasticity in AI map reorganization in response to transient and long-term hearing loss. How changes in neuronal excitability and morphology contribute to cortical map reorganization is less clear. In the present study, we exposed adult rats to a 4-kHz tone at 123 dB, which resulted in increased thresholds over their entire hearing range. The threshold shift gradually recovered in the lower-frequency, but not the higher-frequency, range. As reported previously, two distinct zones were observed 10 days after the noise exposure, an enlarged lower-characteristic frequency (CF) zone displaying normal threshold and enhanced cortical responses and a higher-CF zone showing higher threshold and a disorganized tonotopic map. Membrane excitability of layer II/III pyramidal neurons increased only in the higher-CF, but not the lower-CF, zone. In addition, dendritic morphology and spine density of the pyramidal neurons were altered in the higher-CF zone only. These results indicate that membrane excitability and neuronal morphology are altered by long-term, but not transient, threshold shift. They also suggest that these changes may contribute to tinnitus but are unlikely to be involved in map expansion in the lower-CF zone.},

Hearing-lesioned animals displayed tinnitus with a pitch in the hearing loss range. Furthermore, drugs that enhance inhibition, but not those that reduce excitation, reversibly eliminated the tinnitus behavior.

We investigated the role of homeostatic synaptic plasticity in the development and refinement of frequency representations in the primary auditory cortex using the tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$) knockout (KO), a mutant mouse with impaired homeostatic but normal Hebbian plasticity. Our results indicate that these mice develop weaker tonal responses and incomplete frequency representations. Rearing in a single-frequency revealed a normal expansion of cortical representations in KO mice. However, TNF-$\alpha$ KOs lacked homeostatic adjustments of cortical responses following exposure to multiple frequencies. Specifically, while this sensory over-stimulation resulted in competitive refinement of frequency tuning in wild-type controls, it broadened frequency tuning in TNF-$\alpha$ KOs. Our results suggest that homeostatic plasticity plays an important role in gain control and competitive interaction in sensory cortical development.},

abstract = {This study demonstrates that the adult form of 'tonotopic maps' of sound frequency in the rat primary auditory cortex (A1) arises from parallel developmental processes involving two cortical zones: the progressive differentiation and refinement of selectively tone-responsive receptive fields within an initially broadly-tuned posterior zone, and the progressive loss of tone-evoked, short-latency response over an initially large, very broadly tuned anterior zone. The formation of tonotopic maps in A1 was specifically influenced by a rat pup's early acoustic environments. Exposure to pulsed tones resulted in accelerated emergence and an expansion of A1 representations of those specific tone frequencies, as well as a deteriorated tonotopicity and broader-than-normal receptive fields. Thus, auditory experiences during early postnatal development are important in shaping the functional development of auditory cortical representations of specific acoustic environments.},

abstract = {In the developing frog visual system, topographic refinement of the retinotectal projection depends on electrical activity. In vivo whole-cell recording from developing Xenopus tectal neurons shows that convergent retinotectal synapses undergo activity-dependent cooperation and competition following correlated pre- and postsynaptic spiking within a narrow time window. Synaptic inputs activated repetitively within 20 ms before spiking of the tectal neuron become potentiated, whereas subthreshold inputs activated within 20 ms after spiking become depressed. Thus both the initial synaptic strength and the temporal order of activation are critical for heterosynaptic interactions among convergent synaptic inputs during activity-dependent refinement of developing neural networks.},

abstract = {Trace fear memory requires the activity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and is sensitive to attention-distracting stimuli. Fragile X syndrome is the most common form of mental retardation with many patients exhibiting attention deficits. Previous studies in fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) knock-out (KO) mice, a mouse model for fragile X, focused mainly on hippocampal-dependent plasticity and spatial memory. We demonstrate that FMR1 knock-out mice show a defect in trace fear memory without changes in locomotion, anxiety, and pain sensitivity. Whole-cell path-clamp recordings in the ACC show that long-term potentiation (LTP) was completely abolished. A similar decrease in LTP was found in the lateral amygdala, another structure implicated in fear memory. No significant changes were found in basal synaptic transmission. This suggests that synaptic plasticity in the ACC and amygdala of FMR1 KO mice plays an important role in the expression of behavioral phenotypes similar to the symptoms of fragile X syndrome.},

abstract = {Sensory experiences contribute to the development and specialization of signal processing capacities in the mammalian auditory system during a "critical period" of postnatal development. Earlier studies have shown that passive exposure to tonal stimuli during this postnatal epoch induces a large-scale expansion of the representations of those stimuli within the primary auditory cortex (A1) [Zhang LI, Bao S, Merzenich MM (2001) Persistent and specific influences of early acoustic environments on primary auditory cortex. Nat Neurosci 4:1123-1130]. Here, we show that exposing rat pups through the normal critical period epoch and beyond to continuous, un-modulated, moderate-level tones induces no such representational distortion, and in fact disrupts the normal development of frequency response selectivity and tonotopicity all across area A1. The area of cortex responding selectively to continuously exposed sound frequencies was actually reduced, when compared with rats reared in normal environments. Strong exposure-driven plasticity characteristic of the critical period could be induced well beyond the normal end of the critical period, by simply modulating the tonal stimulus. Thus, continuous tone exposure, like continuous noise exposure [Chang EF, Merzenich MM (2003) Environmental noise retards auditory cortical development. Science 300:498-502], ineffectively induces critical period plasticity, and indefinitely blocks the closure of a normally-brief critical period window. These findings again demonstrate the crucial role of temporally structured inputs for inducing the progressive cortical maturational changes that result in the closure of the critical period window. © 2008 IBRO.},

abstract = {Since its first description >40 years ago, the neurological "critical period" has been predominantly described as an early, plastic postnatal brain development stage that rather abruptly advances to an aplastic or less plastic "adult" stage. Here, we show that chronic exposure of juvenile or adult rats to moderate-level acoustic noise results in a broad reversal of maturational changes that mark the infant-to-adult progression in the primary auditory cortex. In time, noise exposure reinstates critical period plasticity. Cortical changes resulting from noise exposure are again reversed to reestablish a physically and functionally normal adult cortex, by returning animals to natural acoustic environments. These studies show that at least some of neurological changes believed to mark the transition from the infantile to the mature (adult) stage are, by their nature, reversible.},
