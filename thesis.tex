My brain hurt like a warehouse\\
It had no room to spare\\
I had to cram so many things\\
To store everything in there\\
And all the fat-skinny people, and all the tall-short people\\
And all the nobody people, and all the somebody people\\
I never thought I'd need so many people\\

Graduate school is a funny thing. In a way, it is completely unlike anything I've ever seen or experienced. This idea is the primary force behind the popular conception of ``grad school"

as it is to refer to it as a postponement of joining the ``real world," The frontier of human knowledge is as bizarre and unpredictable. And like most frontiers, this one is best explored with some help.
