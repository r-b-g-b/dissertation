My brain hurt like a warehouse\\
It had no room to spare\\
I had to cram so many things\\
To store everything in there\\
And all the fat-skinny people, and all the tall-short people\\
And all the nobody people, and all the somebody people\\
I never thought I'd need so many people\\

Graduate school is a funny thing. The freedom of original scientific research is thrilling, but it can also overwhelm, and in those times, a person's fate is in the hands of those around them. To that point, I want to thank some of the amazing people who I had the pleasure of knowing since arriving in Berkeley in 2009. First, there is my Helen Wills Neuroscience Program cohort: Asako Miyakawa, Benji Gaub, Lucas Pinto, Colleen Kirkhart, Natalia Bilenko, Stephanie Greer, Sarah Hillenbrand, and Helene Moorman---the Zombiebears. (Had we known that name would stick, would we have spent a little bit more time deliberating? Alas, I have no regrets.) It remains one of the great mysteries of my life how a group of people, sharing only the haphazard trait of being accepted into the program the same year, managed to be so completely awesome and just wholly simpatico. In my imagination it involves a guardian angel Helen Wills, but I have a sneaking suspicion that Kati's of-this-worldly magic is somehow the responsible. Which brings me to the next person, the mother of all neuroscientists, the force of nature that is Kati Markowitz. First and foremost, you are the life of every party. Your ability to cooly shepherd me through paperwork errors most egregious, with a minimum of chiding cannot be appreciated enough. Absent your frequent aid, I'm certain I would have found a way to be deported by this point, and I'm a US citizen. Haley Golden, your ear bent further than anyone else's during the last five years. Your belief in me is something I will never forget (and may never understand). The frontier of human knowledge is bizarre and unpredictable. And like most frontiers, this one is best explored with some help.
